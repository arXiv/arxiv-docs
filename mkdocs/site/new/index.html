<p><strong>arXiv created a Systems and Control category eess.SY that will merge with cs.SY. We also merged the existing Numerical Analysis categories math.NA/cs.NA</strong></p>
<p>Two changes to arXiv categories were made today. </p>
<p>The category for Systems and Control is making the move from computer science to electrical engineering and systems science, where it is a better fit. Users can still submit and search for cs.SY, however the canonical display will be eess.SY. The full description for Systems and Control eess.SY is at https://arxiv.org/archive/eess.</p>
<p>arXiv is also merging the math and computer science categories for Numerical Analysis. The category description is: Numerical algorithms for problems in analysis and algebra, scientific computation. The merge will setup math.NA to be the canonical category for cs.NA. </p>
<p>Thank you to arXiv moderators, subject advisory committees, and scientific advisory board members who provided leadership and input on these changes. Special thanks to our math.NA and cs.NA moderators for putting in extra effort over the past two month to pilot this move.</p>

<p><strong>arXiv looks to the future with move to Cornell CIS</strong></p>
<p>We are pleased to announce that arXiv will move from the Cornell University Library (CUL) to Cornell Computing and Information Science (CIS) in January 2019. As far as researchers and arXiv users are concerned, the stewardship transition will be seamless and unnoticeable. Although the arXiv team is currently housed at the Library, the operation is independent of the Library's organizational, technical, and financial infrastructure. We have decided that CIS is better positioned to move arXiv forward into the next phase of the service's development after a careful assessment process. See <a href="https://cis.cornell.edu/arxiv-looks-future-move-cornell-cis">press release</a> and <a href="https://confluence.cornell.edu/x/qspyFQ">transition FAQ</a> for more information.</p>

<p><strong>DONATE to arXiv</strong></p>
<p>arXiv will run an online fundraising campaign for one week, from February 26 to March 4, 2017, to help raise additional funds (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/help/donate">Donations to arXiv</a>). The baseline maintenance costs are sponsored by the 206 member organizations, the Simons Foundation, and Cornell University Library. This online campaign aims to garner additional resources from the program's active and supportive user base.</p>
<p>Stewardship of resources such as arXiv involves not only covering the operational costs but also continuing to enhance their value based on the needs of the user community and the evolving patterns and modes of scholarly communication. It is essential to raise additional funds in order to <a href="https://confluence.cornell.edu/x/y9ZRF">fund new initiatives</a> that are beyond the routine operational work, and to robustly support arXiv's Open Access <a href="https://arxiv.org/help/primer">mission</a>.

This should allow us to keep up with the ever increasing traffic and make several improvements. One is that we now have a cache large enough to store processed PDF versions for all papers -- there should be far fewer "...processing..." responses. We have also put online several software improvements including:</p>
<ul>
<li>arXiv now accepts <a href="/help/submit_docx">submissions in DOCX/OOXML format</a> (from Word 2007 and other OOXML compliant applications).</li>
<li>We have implemented version control for papers submitted prior to November 1997 in the same way as for papers submitted later. In many cases the earlier versions were not recorded and are marked as such in the comments (e.g. <a href="/abs/hep-th/9108006v1">arXiv:hep-th/9108006v1</a>).

<p>There have been a number of upgrades to the arXiv interface and processing system since April 2007. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>arXiv now supports <a href="/help/submit_tex#pdflatex">PDFLaTeX</a>.</em> TeX submissions may now include PDF, JPG, or PNG figures using the standard <code>\includegraphics</code> command from the <code>graphics</code> or <code>graphicx</code> packages.</li>
<li>The article <em><a href="/help/arxiv_identifier">identifier system</a> has been updated</em>. The new scheme (which does not include subject information in the identifier) not only allows for a greater number of submissions each month, but it makes reclassification easier (old identifiers did not permit changes in primary classication after announcement). We also hope that the removal of optional subject-class information from the identifier will lead to more consistent citation and linking.</li>
<li>To find a specific paper for which you know the identifier, you may now simply type or paste the identifier (e.g. <code>hep-th/0501001</code>, <code>0704.0001</code> or <code>arXiv:0704.0002</code>) into the <em>search box at the top of every arXiv page</em>. This facility replaces the "abs" links for each archive that used to be on the main page.</li>
<li>The <em>abstract pages have been redesigned</em> to more cleanly present the most important information (title, authors, abstract, etc.) and to allow more links to related services to be added in column on the right. See, for example, <a href="/abs/0704.1252">arXiv:0704.1252</a></li>
<li>The <em>Statistics archive</em> was <a href="/new/stat_announce">introduced</a> on 1 April 2007.</li>
<li>The category <code>math.IT</code> was created as an alias for <em>Information Theory</em> (<code>cs.IT</code>) so that these papers will show in both math and cs searches.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Change to arXiv identifiers now scheduled for 1 April 2007:</strong> The format of arXiv identifiers will change on 1 April 2007 (postponed from 1 January 2007). See <a href="http://arxiv.org/help/arxiv_identifier#new">Identifier scheme for new submissions beginning 1 April 2007</a> for details.</p>
<h4 id="dec-2006">Dec 2006</h4>
<p>21 Dec 2006</p>
<p><strong>Postponed change to arXiv identifiers:</strong> The format of arXiv identifiers will change early in 2007 (exact transition date to be decided). We have postponed the change from 1 January 2007 to allow more time for us and our collaborators to implement the required software modifications. See <a href="http://arxiv.org/help/arxiv_identifier#new">Identifier scheme for new submissions beginning early 2007</a> for details.</p>
<p>6 Dec 2006</p>
<p><strong>Revised Holiday Schedule:</strong> To enable our administrators to spend local holidays with their families, mailings and the public availability of new submissions will be deferred for 25 Dec, 26 Dec and 1 Jan; the arXiv servers will otherwise remain in operation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Articles received from 16:00 EST Fri 22 Dec 2006 through 16:00 EST Wed 27 Dec 2006 will be announced at 20:00 EST Wed 27 Dec 2006.</li>
<li>Articles received from 16:00 EST Fri 29 Dec 2006 through 16:00 EST Tue 2 Jan 2007 will be announced at 20:00 EST Tue 2 Jan 2007.</li>
</ul>
<p>1 Dec 2006</p>
<p><strong>Change to arXiv identifiers:</strong> The current form of arXiv identifiers (e.g. <strong><code>[arXiv:math.DG/0307245](/abs/math/0307245)</code></strong>) permits only 999 papers per month in any archive -- in October of this year we got to paper <a href="/abs/math/0610989">989</a> in math, just 11 short of difficulty. We thus have an urgent need to extend the maximum number of submissions that can be handled in a month. We will certainly exceed 999 papers in some months for some archives next year.</p>
<p>To address this issue (and several others), we are going to change the format of identifiers for new papers starting in early 2007 (original 1 December announcement said 1 January 2007, since <a href="#ids_2006">postponed</a>) to use the form <strong><code>arXiv:0706.0001</code></strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Software reversion</strong>: For the past three weeks, arXiv has not functioned reliably. We sincerely apologize for not providing the outstanding level of service that users expect.</p>
<p>On 18 Sep 05, we installed new software to allow more flexible and robust classification of arXiv submissions. Unfortunately, the software did not perform as expected and resulted in difficulties and confusion for some of our users.</p>
<p>To restore stability, we reverted to the software used prior to 18 Sep 05. We sincerely regret all inconveniences and are taking steps to ensure that future arXiv developments will be reliable. Thank you for your patience with us.</p>

<p><strong>Scheduled outage:</strong> At 4:00 p.m. EDT on Saturday, 24 Sep 2005, we expect an outage for improvements to Cornell University infrastructure. The outage is scheduled to last 18 hours.</p>
<p>All services related to the main site (submissions, user account info, viewing the e-mail addresses of paper authors, etc.) will be unavailable during this time. People planning to submit papers on that day should either submit them before noon or plan to submit them on the following Monday. Readers should use one of our <a href="/servers">mirror sites</a> to view papers during the outage.</p>
<p>16 Sep 2005</p>
<p><strong>Software upgrade:</strong> There will be a disruption in normal service at the main site beginning at 4 PM EST on Friday, 16 September in order to carry out several software upgrades. The disruption is expected to last less than 24 hours. During that time, the main site will be available for browsing, but the submission and replacement services will be unavailable. People planning to submit/replace papers should do so either early Friday or on the following Sunday.</p>
<p>In addition, papers received before 4 PM EST on 16 Sep will be announced at 8 PM EST <em>that same evening</em>, as opposed to the normal 8 PM EST Sunday time for papers received on a Friday. This will be done to minimize the possibility of errors with the software cutover.</p>
<p>7 Sep 2005</p>
<p><strong>Physics reorganization:</strong> The physics section of arXiv will be undergoing an extensive reorganization. Over the last few months, the physics advisory committee members and section moderators have been extensively discussing <a href="http://arxiv.org/new/physics">a new organization and classification scheme</a>, which would hopefully be implemented within the next several months.</p>

<p><strong>Scheduled outage:</strong>At noon EST on Sunday, 1 Aug 2004, we expect a scheduled outage for a planned hardware upgrade. Because we need to synchronize the database and other files between the two machines, we will need to disable incoming submissions for several hours. People planning to submit papers on that day should either submit them before noon or plan to submit them on the following Monday.</p>
<p>If all goes as planned, it should be possible to browse papers on arXiv during most of the upgrade. If you do have problems, we recommend that you use one of our <a href="http://arxiv.org/servers">mirror sites.</a></p>
<p>Features that require user login, such as viewing the e-mail addresses of paper authors, will be disabled during the upgrade.</p>

<p><strong>Endorsement System:</strong> ArXiv initiates an endorsement system for new submitters. Initially, only a small fraction of submitters will be asked to provide endorsement. As the system is phased in, most new submitters will require endorsement. Existing submitters may not require endorsement for topics in which they have been active.</p>
<p>arXiv is an openly accessible, moderated repository for scholarly papers in specific scientific disciplines. Material submitted to arXiv is expected to be of interest, relevance, and value to those disciplines.</p>
<p>arXiv was developed to be, and remains, a means for specific communities of scientists to exchange information. Moderators and the arXiv administrative team have worked behind the scenes to ensure that content is appropriate to the user communities. The growth in number of submissions to arXiv necessitates an automated endorsement system. Current members of arXiv scientific communities will have the opportunity to endorse new submitters. This process will ensure that arXiv content is relevant to current research while controlling costs so we can continue to offer free and open Web access to all.

<p>The nlin-sys archives have been reorganized starting 1 January, 2000. The archives adap-org, chao-dyn, comp-gas, patt-sol, and solv-int have been subsumed as subject classes in the new " <a href="/archive/nlin">nlin</a>" archive (see <a href="http://arXiv.org/new/nlin">nlin info</a> for more information). The intent is to bring these archives into conformity with the format of the newer archives, and to facilitate further expansion or reorganization. (Note that this also means these archives will now be updated -- and abstract mailings issued -- every weekday, rather than just once per week.) Beginning 1 Jan 2000, chao-dyn submissions for example should be sent To: nlin@arXiv.org with the added line (i.e. following Title:, Author:, etc.):</p>
<p><strong>Subj-class:</strong> Chaotic Dynamics</p>
<p>and analogously for the other above subsumed archives. Submissions to chao-dyn@arXiv.org will be automatically rerouted as above, and assigned numbers beginning with nlin.CD/0001001. As a replacement for the cross-listing mechanism (between nlin archives), use multiple Subj-class: entries separated by ;'s (the first is the primary). It is also possible to subscribe to receive daily abstract notifications for any subset of the nlin-sys subject classes (see <a href="http://arXiv.org/new/nlinsub">nlin subscribe</a> -- current e-mail subscribers have been automatically transferred). Comments or suggestions for possible reorganization of the subject classes can be sent to www-admin@arxiv.org.</p>

<p>New domain name arXiv.org registered. All of archive.org, archives.org, thearchive.org, thearchives.org were already taken. Since the word 'archive' has a Greek root, X indicates the Greek Chi, imitating Donald Knuth's usage in the scientific typesetting language TeX (pronounced Tech), also preserving at least one of the original three x's. Note also that the word archive itself goes back to the greek "archos" for ruler, or "arche" to begin or rule, where "archeion" was the government house, and led to the latin "archivum" as a place where public records or historical documents were preserved -- hence it was natural for what is now arXiv to have in the .gov domain.</p>

<p>Note on upcoming reorganization of Mathematical Physics section: At the behest of the IAMP (=International Association of Mathematical Physics), starting 1 April 1998 the Mathematical Physics section of the archives will be reorganized to bridge the physics and the recently reorganized math groupings. The current "Mathematical Methods in Physics" subject class of the physics archive will be subsumed into a new "Mathematical Physics" archive math-ph@xxx.lanl.gov , to which future submissions should be sent. (If you are not sure whether or not your submission is physics, then it should be sent to math-ph). Submissions will also automatically appear under a "MP = Mathematical Physics" subject class of the math archive, and as usual can be cross-listed elsewhere. Current e-mail subscribers to "Mathematical Methods in Physics" will automatically be subscribed to the new archive. Current math subscribers can add the MP subject class starting 1 Apr.</p>

<p>The <a href="/help/pdf">PDF</a> produced here now includes subsetted embedded fonts. This was made feasible by the new font compression format (CFF/Type 2) introduced in PDF-1.2 (see <a href="#pdf1.2">13 Nov 1997</a>). This more compactified Type1 format reduced the byte cost of font inclusion by more than a factor of three.</p>
<p>Note that not all PDF viewers support the font compression format (e.g. under NeXTStep, only PDFView.app (1.7) supports it; while the current versions of OmniPDF.app (2.1.3) and PDFViewer.app do not support it).</p>

<p>The math archives will be reorganized starting 1 January, 1998. The archives alg-geom, dg-ga, funct-an, and q-alg will be subsumed as subject classes in the new "math" archive (started 12/97 -- see <a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/new/math">math info</a> for more information). The intent is to provide a better organized framework for coverage of additional mathematical subject areas. Beginning 1 Jan 1998, q-alg submissions for example should be sent to math@xxx.lanl.gov with the added line (i.e. following Title:, Author:, etc.):</p>
<p><strong>Subj-class:</strong> Quantum Algebra<br />
(the AMS Mathematical Subject Classification(s) should now appear on an <strong>MSC-class:</strong> line). Submissions to q-alg@xxx.lanl.gov will be automatically rerouted as above, and assigned numbers beginning with math.QA/9801001. As a replacement for the cross-listing mechanism (between math archives), use multiple Subj-class: entries separated by ;'s (the first is the primary). It is also possible to subscribe to receive daily abstract notifications for any subset of the math subject classes (see <a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/new/mathsub">math subscribe</a> -- current e-mail subscribers will be automatically transferred).<br />

<p>5 Dec 1997</p>
<p>Due to the healthy growth of the astro-ph archive, we are considering a Subj-class: organization similar to that which exists for the cond-mat and and physics archives. Suggested subject classes include: Cosmology and Large Scale Structure, Extra-Galactic Astronomy, Galactic Astronomy, Stars and the Interstellar Medium, Compact Objects, Planetary Systems, Stellar and Galactic Dynamics, High Energy Astrophysics, Instrumentation and Methods, History and Education. (The subject classes function effectively as separate "archives", though the collective astro-ph archive will of course continue to exist as well.)

<p>15 May</p>
<p><strong>Minor</strong> change in policy (affects only weekend submissions): the deadline for submissions to appear in the Sunday night mailing is moved back to Friday 18:00 LANL time (currently 00:00 GMT). Submissions received during the rest of the weekend will appear with Monday submissions in the Monday night mailing. After consultation with a large segment of the relevant community, it was determined to continue to delay the announcements of papers received on Fridays until Sunday nights (Monday mornings in Europe), rather than shift the Sunday mailing to Friday night. In a related development, responses to any queries received during the weekend may also be deferred until Monday morning (9:00 LANL time = 1500 GMT) -- Note that 99.97% of all e-mail queries are already answered in our <a href="/help">comprehensive on-line help pages</a> and <a href="/help/faqindex">frequently asked questions</a> section. Recall also that any replacements received after the 18:00 LANL time deadline Mon-Fri constitute a new (revised) version. Please note that whether or not your submission makes the deadline on any given weekday is unlikely to alter markedly the future evolution of the cosmos.</p>

The latter two will soon be upgraded, and additional mirror sites are anticipated within the next few months. The goal is a more robust global server system (to avoid relapse to the medieval days when hardcopy took days, weeks, or months to arrive...).</p>

<p>On 1 Oct '96, a new "physics" archive will go on-line, and is intended to facilitate growth into areas not currently covered. Submissions will be required to have a Subj-class: field that will effectively keyword partition the archive (for subscriptions, listings, and searches). Existing archives will for the most part remain unaffected. A very provisional list of canonical subject-classes be found at http://xxx.lanl.gov/new/physics , and can be modified as needed. Constructive suggestions solicited.</p>

<p>Minor policy change: the deadline for submissions to appear in the daily mailings has been moved six hours earlier to 18:00 US Mountain time (i.e., currently 00:00 GMT, and 01:00 GMT during the winter) Sunday through Thursday. The mailings will continue to commence (and web interface updated) shortly after midnight on those days (i.e., currently 06:00 GMT Mon-Fri, and 07:00 GMT during winter). Those few submissions received between 18:00 and midnight mountain time will appear in the next day's mailing. For the most part, this change will be invisible (and will primarily affect late night submissions from the US east coast, sparing us all the 2 a.m. typos...).</p>
