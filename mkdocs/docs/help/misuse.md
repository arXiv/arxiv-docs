Misuse of arXiv Policy or Resources
===================================

You may have been re-directed to this page because we believe the
service which has directed you to arXiv may be violating arXiv policies
and/or misusing arXiv resources.

This page details known and suspected problem services; we recommend
arXiv users avoid them.

A common form of misuse of arXiv resources is the harvesting of user
emails for the purpose of spamming users. As noted on arXiv's privacy
page ([http://arxiv.org/help/email-protection](/help/email-protection.md)):

*Email addresses or other personal information collected from arXiv data
must not be abused for unsolicited emailing or other forms of spam.*
