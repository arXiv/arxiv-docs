Support for data sets associated with arXiv articles
====================================================

arXiv is primarily an [archive and distribution service for research
articles](/help/primer.md). arXiv provides support for data sets and other
ancillary materials only in direct connection with research articles
submitted.

arXiv supports the inclusion of **[ancillary files](/help/ancillary_files.md)**
of modest size with articles.  If you are including multiple page datasets or code with your submission please use the ancillary file option rather than embed them in the full text. The ancillary files are stored in the
source package on arXiv and facilities are available to download either
the entire source package or individual files. The ability to add
ancillary files is available as part of the normal arXiv [submission
process](None).
