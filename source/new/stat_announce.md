# Announcement of new Statistics (stat) archive

1 April 2007

Dear Colleagues:

We would like to announce that Statistics, up to now a category within the Math archive, will now be a top-level archive. See [http://arxiv.org/archive/stat](https://arxiv.org/archive/stat). The existing math.ST category will be linked to new stat.TH category. Submissions to one will automatically appear in the other.

We urge researchers in statistics and related fields to submit their preprints to this archive. Both theoretical and applied contributions are welcome. The archive is open access.

The [Institute of Mathematical Statistics](http://imstat.org/) (IMS) and the [Bernoulli Society](http://isi.cbs.nl/bs.htm) are planning to post all articles published in their statistics journals ([Annals of Statistics](http://imstat.org/aos/), [Statistical Science](http://imstat.org/sts/), [Annals of Applied Statistics](http://imstat.org/aoas/), [Electronic Journal of Statistics](http://imstat.org/ejs/) and [Statistics Surveys](http://www.i-journals.org/ss/)) and statistics articles in the journal [Bernoulli](http://isi.cbs.nl/bernoulli/), while papers in the probability journals [Annals of Probability](http://imstat.org/aop/), [Annals of Applied Probability](http://imstat.org/aap/) and [Probability Surveys](http://www.i-journals.org/ps/), and probability articles in [Bernoulli](http://isi.cbs.nl/bernoulli/) will continue to be posted to math.PR.

Instructions for registration, submission and subscription to the archive can be found at [http://arxiv.org/help/registerhelp](../help/registerhelp.md).

The statistics archive is organized into the following five categories:

* **Applications** (stat.AP):

  Biology, Education, Epidemiology, Engineering, Environmental Sciences, Medical, Physical Sciences, Quality Control, Social Sciences

* **Computation** (stat.CO):

  Algorithms, Simulation, Visualization

 * **Machine Learning** (stat.ML):  

   Classification, Graphical Models, High Dimensional Inference

* **Methodology** (stat.ME):

  Design, Surveys, Model Selection, Multiple Testing, Multivariate Methods, Signal and Image Processing, Time Series, Smoothing, Spatial Statistics, Survival Analysis, Nonparametric and Semiparametric Methods

* **Theory** (stat.TH, linked to math.ST):

  Asymptotics, Bayesian Inference, Decision Theory, Estimation, Foundations, Inference, Testing

All submissions are required to choose a primary category, with the option for one or more secondary categories. Subscribers of the archive will receive by e-mail the title/abstracts of all submissions in their chosen categories on a regular basis.

arXiv:stat is sponsored by the [Institute of Mathematical Statistics](http://imstat.org/) and by the [Bernoulli Society](http://isi.cbs.nl/BS/bshome.htm).

The statistics archive is overseen by an advisory committee consisting of the following members: Larry Wasserman (coordinator), David Banks, Chad Schafer, Dave Higdon, Rob Strawderman, Susan Holmes and Jim Pitman.

Sincerely,  
[Larry Wasserman](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/),  
arXiv:stat coordinator
