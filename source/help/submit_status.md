# Submission Status

A new submission or an update to an article (replacement, cross list,
journal reference or DOI addition, or withdrawal) may traverse several
status values while it is in process. The meanings of these status
values are described below:

-   [incomplete](#incomplete) - in process but not submitted
-   [processing](#processing) - already submitted and being analyzed by
    arXiv
-   [submitted](#submitted) - in the queue to be announced
-   [on hold](#on_hold) - delayed pending moderation attention

All submissions and updates associated with your arXiv user account are
shown on the [user page](https://arxiv.org/user). Upon announcement articles will move
from the "Article Submissions" to the "Articles You Own" section.

<span id="incomplete"></span>

Incomplete
----------

When your submission is in this status, the article is in process, but
not yet [submitted](#submitted). You may still edit it which will update
the [expiration date](#exipred). Submissions left incomplete past the
expiration date will be deleted from arXiv.

<span id="processing"></span>

Processing
----------

When your submission is in this status, the article has been submitted,
but arXiv still needs to process your submission before setting the
status to either \[[submitted](#submitted)\] status, or if issues
requiring administrator attention are detected, to \[[on
hold](#on_hold)\] status. During this time you may not edit the
submission. Generally, submissions will be in this status for a
relatively short time period.

<span id="submitted"></span>

Submitted
---------

Your new submission, replacement, cross list, journal reference, or withdrawal has been submitted. 
Your submission is currently set to be posted based on the [automated announcement schedule](availability.md). Note that all submissions to arXiv go through a series of automated and human checks as [part of moderation](moderation/index.md) that may result in a delay.

**New submissions and replacements**: Once you have verified that your
intended submission appears in the format you desire, and you have
finalized all of the [metadata](prep.md), this is the final status it
will pass through before it is announced. On your [user page](https://arxiv.org/user).
You may select the Unsubmit icon (![Unsubmit](https://arxiv.org/images/unsubmit.png)) to
remove it from this status, and return it to [incomplete](submit_status.md#incomplete) status.

<span id="on_hold"></span>

On Hold
-------

All submissions to arXiv go through a series of automated and human checks as [part of moderation](moderation/index.md). 

When a submission goes on hold, arXiv editors will either send you an email with instructions on resolving the hold or resolve the hold without your needing to do anything. We will contact you using the email address in your user account if any follow up is required.

No action is required on your part at this time. 

Due to the large volume of submissions the process may take several days. We appreciate your patience.

Please do not make a duplicate submission while your work is on hold. Deleting and resubmitting your work will lead to further delays.

On Hold submissions will not expire.


<span id="expired"></span>

Expiration
----------

If you neither submit nor update your submission within 14 days, it will
be removed. Any update to your submission will prevent it from being
automatically removed and reset the 14 day expiration period.
