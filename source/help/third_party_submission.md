# Third party submission

In general [author self-submission](../help/submit/index.md) is preferred because our
experience shows that there are far fewer errors and misunderstandings
than with submissions made by third-parties. However, arXiv does permit
and provide special facilities for third party submission by trusted
proxies in some circumstances. 

Remember that [submissions cannot be removed once announced](versions.md),
changes may be made only by [replacement](replace.md) which creates a new
version and will not erase the original.

Proxy submission requirements
-----------------------------

arXiv has special facilities for **proxy** submitters. Potential proxy
submitters must contact [arXiv user support](http://arxiv.org/support/general_help) and provide a reason for the request, confirming that
the requirements below will be met.

-   Proxy submitters must provide a valid contact email address to a
    reliable and named contact person when creating an arXiv account.
-   Articles are subject to
    arXiv's [moderation process](moderation/index.md).
-   As part of moderation, arXiv does not accept duplicate content. If a work already exists on arXiv then any [new versions](versions.md) should be replacements of the existing arXiv version. In cases where an author already has a paper on arXiv and the same paper or updated version of the same paper is submitted from a proxy, the submission will not be accepted as a new work. arXiv will inform the proxy of the existing arXiv identifier and how to post the new version [as a replacement](replace.md).
-   Articles must be classified individually and carefully based on
    their content rather than being submitted to a category based solely
    on the focus of the conference or journal in which they appear.
-   Articles that are not appropriate to a category within arXiv should
    not be submitted and will be declined.
-   Metadata must be validated by an author of the article prior to
    submission (provide details from, or links to, arXiv [preparation
    instructions](prep.md)).
-   Submissions may be made either manually via arXiv's normal
    submission interface (see [submission help](submit/index.md)) or via our
    automated SWORD interface (see [SWORD help](submit_sword.md) and contact
    [arXiv user support](http://arxiv.org/support/general_help) for permission).
-   An email address for the corresponding author must be provided with
    each submission (this will be requested in addition to other
    metadata when submissions are made via proxy submission accounts; it
    is a separate metadata field for SWORD deposits).
-   Proxy submitters must not make more than 10 submissions in a day
    without prior approval from arXiv administrators.
-   When submitting TeX source, the complete source files (see [TeX
    source help](submit_tex.md)) must be provided to enable processing.
    When author-produced PDF is submitted, *only* the PDF file should be
    uploaded ([PDF submission help](submit_pdf.md)).
-   There are some test facilities for those developing new SWORD upload
    software or to check particular TeX processing requirements.
    Contact [arXiv user support](http://arxiv.org/support/general_help) if you have a need for these
    facilities.

Proxy submission privileges may be revoked temporarily or permanently if
a proxy submitter violates these rules or otherwise causes excessive
numbers of problems. If in doubt, please ask [arXiv user support](http://arxiv.org/support/general_help).
