# The arXiv endorsement system

arXiv requires that users be *endorsed*
before submitting their first paper to a category.

## Why does arXiv require endorsement?
-----------------------------------

The endorsement system verifies that arXiv contributors belong to the scientific community in a fair and sustainable way that can scale with arXiv's growth. 

Please read our [blog post](https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/2025/12/10/updated-endorsement-policy-for-arxiv-mathematics) about recent changes to the Math section endorsement process. 


## How can I get endorsed?

arXiv may give some people automatic endorsements based on subject area, topic, previous submissions, and institutional affiliation. In most cases, automatic endorsement is given to authors from known academic institutions and research facilities who are an author or owner of at least one submission in arXiv. 

First time submitters to arXiv are encouraged to associate an institutional email address if they have one (see [author registration](registerhelp.md) help). This will expedite the endorsement process.

Authors who are submitting papers to a subject category for the first time are required to get an endorsement from an established arXiv author. Detailed instructions on how to proceed with the endorsement request are provided at that time.

If you need to be endorsed by someone, it is best for you to find an endorser who

- you know personally and 

- is knowledgeable in the subject area of your work.

A good choice for graduate students would be your thesis advisor or another professor in your department/institution working in your field who is also an active author on arXiv.

Alternatively this is the recommended way to proceed.

1. Start a new submission and select the category you wish to submit to.

2. Check your email for an 'endorsement request email'. This will include a link you can provide to prospective endorsers.

3. Next, look for related articles in your field. If your article has citations to recent papers in arXiv, look for those papers in arXiv to find an endorser.

4. Bring up these abstracts from the arXiv page.

5. You can find somebody qualified to endorse by clicking on the link titled "Which of these authors are endorsers?" at the bottom of every abstract page.

6. Using that information, you can then find the email address of the potential endorser on the abstract page just under the "Submission history" heading.

7. Contact eligible endorsers and send them the ‘endorsement request email’. You may include a link to your ORCID profile, other scholarly profile, or a copy of your intended submission if you are comfortable doing so. Please note, however, that it is inappropriate to email large numbers of potential endorsers at once, or to repeatedly email the same endorser with a request for endorsement.

8. At least one positive endorsement is required per endorsement category to be considered endorsed for that category.

arXiv reserves the right to revoke any submitter's endorsement if that submitter has violated arXiv policies.


## Who can endorse?

Endorsers must have authored a certain number of papers within the *endorsement domain* of a subject area. The number of papers depends on the particular subject area, but has been set so that any active scientist who has been working in their field for a few years should be able to endorse if their work has been submitted to arXiv and if they are registered as an author of their papers. **Endorsement domains** have been chosen to reflect related subject areas and ensure that it will be easy for people to find endorsements: most high-level subject areas (e.g.,
hep-th, cond-mat, q-bio) are currently endorsement domains, with the notable exception of physics, in which individual subject classes (e.g., phys.acc-phys, phys.med-ph) are endorsement domains. To ensure that endorsers are active members of the community, we only count papers that have been submitted between three months and five years ago.\*

If you would like to be able to endorse, the most important thing that
you can do is make sure that you are registered as an author of your
papers. If you can get the *paper password* for a paper you can [claim
ownership](https://arxiv.org/auth/need-paper-password) of a paper immediately. If you
don't have the paper password, you can [request
ownership](https://arxiv.org/auth/request-ownership) of a paper. Note that you must also
have an active positive endorsement to that area yourself before you may
endorse for that subject classification.

\* We reserve the right to suspend a person's ability to endorse.

## What are my responsibilities as an endorser?

**The endorsement process is not peer review.** You should know the
person that you endorse **or** you should see the paper that the person
intends to submit. We don't expect you to read the paper in detail, or
verify that the work is correct, but you should check that the paper is
appropriate for the subject area. You should not endorse the author if
the author is unfamiliar with the basic facts of the field, or if the
work is entirely disconnected with current work in the area. If you are
sent a paper to read, you should treat that content as privileged
information and respect its confidentiality as you would if you were
asked to review it for a journal.

If an author asks you for endorsement, they will send you a
six-character alphanumeric *endorsement code*. After you enter this code
on the [endorsement form](https://arxiv.org/auth/endorse), you can tell us that you
**do** or **do not** wish to endorse a person. If you wish to abstain
from the endorsement process altogether, do not submit anything on the
endorsement form. If you choose not to endorse a author, you **should**
use the endorsement form to explicitly tell us that you do not wish to
endorse this person, and this will be recorded as a negative vote of
endorsement.

The fact that you have personally endorsed or not endorsed a person (as
well as any optional comments) is private between you and the arXiv
administrators – this information will not be shared with arXiv users or
the person requesting endorsement, although under certain circumstances
an author might be able to infer your action.

If you feel uncomfortable about endorsing an author for any reason, do
not do it – ask the person to find another endorser. Only provide
endorsement to authors seeking to submit their own work, not to
third-parties or proxies.
