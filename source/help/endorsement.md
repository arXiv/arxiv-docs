# The arXiv endorsement system

arXiv requires that users be endorsed before submitting their first paper to arXiv or a new category.

As an arXiv author, your support is crucial for maintaining the quality of submissions. We ask that you only endorse individuals when you are confident they will submit high-quality research papers. Additionally, please encourage submitters to review relevant prior research before submitting to arXiv.


## Why does arXiv require endorsement?

The endorsement system verifies that arXiv contributors belong to the scientific community in a fair and sustainable way that can scale with arXiv's growth. 

Please read our [blog post](https://blog.arxiv.org/2026/01/21/attention-authors-updated-endorsement-policy) about changes to the endorsement process. 


## How can I get endorsed?

First time submitters to arXiv are encouraged to associate an institutional email address if they have one (see [author registration help](registerhelp.md)). This will expedite the endorsement process.

Your account may receive endorsement if:

- you have [claimed ownership](authority.md#for-other-authors) of a paper submitted by a co-author

- _and_ your email address meets the institutional email criteria


If you have an institutional email but have not claimed ownership of work you have contributed to as an author:

- you will need to [claim your papers](authority.md#for-other-authors).

If you are the submitting author or have claimed papers but do not have an institutional email:

- you will need to update your email address to an institutional email.

Alternatively you can seek personal endorsement from an established arXiv author. Detailed instructions on how to proceed with the endorsement request are provided at that time.

If you need to be endorsed by someone, it is best for you to find an endorser who

- you know personally and 

- is knowledgeable in the subject area of your work.

A good choice for graduate students would be your thesis advisor or another professor in your department/institution working in your field who is also an active author on arXiv.

### To seek personal endorsement: 

1. Start a new submission and select the category you wish to submit to.

2. Check your email for an **endorsement request email**. This will include a link you can provide to prospective endorsers.

3. Next, look for related articles in your field. If your article has citations to recent papers in arXiv, look for those papers in arXiv to find an endorser.

4. Bring up these abstracts from the arXiv page.

5. You can find somebody qualified to endorse by clicking on the link titled, **Which of these authors are endorsers?**, at the bottom of every abstract page.

6. Using that information, you can then find the email address of the potential endorser on the abstract page just under the **Submission history** heading.

7. Contact eligible endorsers and send them the **endorsement request email**. You may include a link to your ORCID profile, other scholarly profile, or a copy of your intended submission if you are comfortable doing so. Please note, however, that it is inappropriate to email large numbers of potential endorsers at once, or to repeatedly email the same endorser with a request for endorsement.

8. At least one positive endorsement is required per endorsement category to be considered endorsed for that category.

arXiv reserves the right to revoke any submitter's endorsement if that submitter has violated arXiv policies.

## Who can endorse?

Endorsers must have authored a certain number of papers within the *endorsement domain* of a subject area. The number of papers depends on the particular subject area, but has been set so that any active scientist who has been working in their field for a few years should be able to endorse if their work has been submitted to arXiv and if they are registered as an author of their papers. **Endorsement domains** have been chosen to reflect related subject areas and ensure that it will be easy for people to find endorsements: most high-level subject areas (e.g., hep-th, cond-mat, q-bio) are currently endorsement domains, with the notable exception of physics, in which individual subject classes (e.g., phys.acc-phys, phys.med-ph) are endorsement domains. To ensure that endorsers are active members of the community, we only count papers that have been submitted between three months and five years ago.\*

If you would like to be able to endorse, the most important thing that you can do is make sure that you are registered as an author of your papers. If you can get the *paper password* for a paper you can [claim ownership](https://arxiv.org/auth/need-paper-password) of a paper immediately. If you do not have the paper password, you can [request
ownership](https://arxiv.org/auth/request-ownership) of a paper. Note that you must also have an active positive endorsement to that area yourself before you may endorse for that subject classification.

\* We reserve the right to suspend a person's ability to endorse.

## What are my responsibilities as an endorser?

**The endorsement process is not peer review.** You should know the person that you endorse **or** you should see the paper that the person intends to submit. We do not expect you to read the paper in detail, or verify that the work is correct, but you should check that the paper is appropriate for the subject area. You should not endorse the author if
the author is unfamiliar with the basic facts of the field, or if the work is entirely disconnected with current work in the area. If you are sent a paper to read, you should treat that content as privileged information and respect its confidentiality as you would if you were asked to review it for a journal.

If an author asks you for endorsement, they will send you a
six-character alphanumeric *endorsement code*. After you enter this code on the [endorsement form](https://arxiv.org/auth/endorse), you can tell us that you **do** or **do not** wish to endorse a person. If you wish to abstain from the endorsement process altogether, do not submit anything on the
endorsement form. If you choose not to endorse an author, you **should** use the endorsement form to explicitly tell us that you do not wish to endorse this person, and this will be recorded as a negative vote of endorsement.

The fact that you have personally endorsed or not endorsed a person (as well as any optional comments) is private between you and the arXiv administrators – this information will not be shared with arXiv users or the person requesting endorsement, although under certain circumstances
an author might be able to infer your action.

If you feel uncomfortable about endorsing an author for any reason, do not do it – ask the person to find another endorser. Only provide endorsement to authors seeking to submit their own work, not to third-parties or proxies.
