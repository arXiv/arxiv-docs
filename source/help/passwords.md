# Passwords in arXiv

arXiv uses two types of passwords:

-   User account passwords for accessing [your user account page](https://arxiv.org/user)
-   Paper passwords for claiming ownership of an announced article submitted by
    co-authors or a proxy

## User account passwords:


-   Details about setting up your account are on our [registration help page.](../help/registerhelp.md)
-   If you forgot your user account password, please see the [lost
    password form](https://arxiv.org/user/lost_password).
-   If you need help recovering an arXiv user account, please [contact arXiv administrators](../help/contact.md) for support.

## Paper passwords:

arXiv maintains [authority records](../help/authority.md) for the works within our corpus.
These are the list of author accounts who are authorized to make changes (referred to as the **owner**).
When an article is first submitted to arXiv, the submitter is the only owner of that work. 
They receive the **paper password** as part of the announcement e-mail when the final 
arXiv-id is assigned. See [authority records](../help/authority.md) for more information regarding 
how co-authors may become an owner. 

You can also retrieve your paper password in the [**articles you own**](https://arxiv.org/user/#owned-articles) section of your account. Click on the **share** icon (<img alt="replace icon" src="https://arxiv.org/images/fa-icon-share.svg" />) in the **actions** column next to your paper and the password will be emailed to you.
