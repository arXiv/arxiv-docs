# Availability of submissions

Submissions to arXiv are typically made public Sunday through
Thursday, with no announcements Friday or Saturday. Check the [current
time](https://arxiv.org/localtime) at the arXiv main site, with the
amount of time remaining before the deadline. Submissions are made public as part of the scheduled announcement process. This includes new submissions as well as [replacements](replace.md), [withdrawal notices](withdraw.md), [cross listings](cross.md) and [journal reference](jref.md). Journal reference submissions do not appear in the mailings, but are still processed at that time. 

Note that all submissions are subject to [moderation](moderation/index.md) which may result in delays.

## A note about arXiv-id assignments

The final [arXiv identifier](arxiv_identifier.md) is assigned as part of the automated process when the work is announced. It is not possible to generate or to be provided with the arXiv identifier or DOI in advance. Submitting authors will receive an email when the work is announced and it will appear on their account dashboard.

**Note:** The arXiv identifier cannot be back-dated, so identifiers will be assigned in the month of first announcement. It may be the case that a submission appears in a different identifier month than its original submission date due to various factors.
