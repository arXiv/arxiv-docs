# About the Physics Archive

The physics archive was started in August 1991 and includes astro-ph, cond-mat, gr-qc, hep-ex, hep-lat, hep-ph, hep-th, math-ph, nucl-ex,nucl-th, physics and quant-ph.

You can browse articles and view categories at the individual archive pages:

- Astrophysics [astro-ph](https://arxiv.org/archive/astro-ph)
- Condensed Matter [cond-mat](https://arxiv.org/archive/cond-mat)
- General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology [gr-qc](https://arxiv.org/archive/gr-qc)
- High Energy Physics - Experiment [hep-ex](https://arxiv.org/archive/hep-ex)
- High Energy Physics - Lattice [hep-lat](https://arxiv.org/archive/hep-lat)
- High Energy Physics - Phenomenology [hep-ph](https://arxiv.org/archive/hep-ph)
- High Energy Physics - Theory [hep-th](https://arxiv.org/archive/hep-th)
- Mathematical Physics [math-ph](https://arxiv.org/archive/math-ph)

## The arXiv Physics Section Editorial Committee:

The advisory committee members serve as consultants to Cornell University and to the [arXiv Editorial Advisory Council](../../about/people/editorial_advisory_council.md). All arXiv policy decisions are ultimately made by Cornell University.

- Ralph Wijers, University of Amsterdam (chair)
- Jacques Distler, University of Texas, Austin
- Victor Galitski, University of Maryland
- Daniel Gottesman, University of Maryland
- Michael Lawler, Cornell University
- Axel Naumann, CERN
- Susan Ramlo, University of Akron
- Chris Reynolds, University of Maryland
- Sakura Schafer-Nameki, University of Oxford
- Rena Zieve, University of California, Davis
- Doris Kim, Soongsil University

## Historical notes
- 2023-07: new arXiv bylaws adopted, by which Physics Advisory Committee renamed Physics Editorial Committee
- 2013-07 - Advisory committee re-organized.
- 2009-01 - We have implemented the long-awaited division of the **astro-ph** archive, see [astro-ph archive details](https://arxiv.org/archive/astro-ph). All new astro-ph submissions must be placed within a sub-category. It is intended that existing astro-ph articles will be machine classified according to this new scheme when enough training data has been collected from new submissions.
- 2008-12 - We have launched a the Quantitative Finance ([q-fin](../../new/q-fin_announce.md)) archive to house articles that have historically been submitted to **cond-mat** or **physics.soc-ph**.
- 2007-04 - The reformulation of the [arXiv identifiers](../../help/arxiv_identifier.md) in April 2007 means that the physics reorganization proposed in 2005 is no longer necessary. We have the flexibility to change category names, add new categories, and reclassify articles without the need to change the names of the existing physics archives.
