# Math Endorsement

The endorsement system verifies that arXiv contributors belong to the scientific community in a fair and sustainable way that can scale with arXiv's growth. 

We have changed the endorsement process for the Math archive, read more in our [blog post](https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/2025/12/10/updated-endorsement-policy-for-arxiv-mathematics).

Your account may receive automatic endorsement if:

- you have [claimed ownership](authority.md#for-other-authors) of a paper submitted by a co-author

- _and_ your email address meets the institutional email criteria


If you have an institutional email but have not claimed ownership of work you have contributed to as an author:

- you will need to [claim your papers](authority.md#for-other-authors).

If you are the submitting author or have claimed papers but do not have an institutional email:

- you will need to update your email address to an institutional email.

First time submitters to arXiv are encouraged to associate an institutional email address if they have one (see [author registration help](registerhelp.md)). This will expedite the endorsement process.


arXiv requires that users be endorsed before submitting their first paper to arXiv or a new category.

## Why does arXiv require endorsement?

The endorsement system verifies that arXiv contributors belong to the scientific community in a fair and sustainable way that can scale with arXiv's growth. 

First time submitters to arXiv are encouraged to associate an institutional email address if they have one (see [author registration](registerhelp.md) help). This will expedite the endorsement process.

Authors who are submitting papers to a subject category for the first time are required to get an endorsement from an established arXiv author. Detailed instructions on how to proceed with the endorsement request are provided at that time.

If you need to be endorsed by someone, it is best for you to find an endorser who

- you know personally and 

- is knowledgeable in the subject area of your work.

A good choice for graduate students would be your thesis advisor or another professor in your department/institution working in your field who is also an active author on arXiv.

Alternatively this is the recommended way to proceed.

1. Start a new submission and select the category you wish to submit to.

2. Check your email for an 'endorsement request email'. This will include a link you can provide to prospective endorsers.

3. Next, look for related articles in your field. If your article has citations to recent papers in arXiv, look for those papers in arXiv to find an endorser.

4. Bring up these abstracts from the arXiv page.

5. You can find somebody qualified to endorse by clicking on the link titled "Which of these authors are endorsers?" at the bottom of every abstract page.

6. Using that information, you can then find the email address of the potential endorser on the abstract page just under the "Submission history" heading.

7. Contact eligible endorsers and send them the ‘endorsement request email’. You may include a link to your ORCID profile, other scholarly profile, or a copy of your intended submission if you are comfortable doing so. Please note, however, that it is inappropriate to email large numbers of potential endorsers at once, or to repeatedly email the same endorser with a request for endorsement.

8. At least one positive endorsement is required per endorsement category to be considered endorsed for that category.

arXiv reserves the right to revoke any submitter's endorsement if that submitter has violated arXiv policies.
