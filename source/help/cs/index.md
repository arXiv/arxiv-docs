# Computer Science archive

Welcome to the Computing Research Repository (CoRR) in arXiv. The Computer Science section of arXiv was established in 1998 through a partnership of the Association for Computing Machinery, the Networked Computer Science Technical Reference Library, and arXiv.

You can view the subject category descriptions and browse papers from the [main CS archive page](https://arxiv.org/archive/cs). New readers and authors to arXiv should see our help pages for [registration](../registerhelp.md), [submission](../submit.md) and [subscription](../subscribe.md).

The [moderators for cs are listed here](https://arxiv.org/moderators/#cs).

## CoRR Advisory Committee

The advisory committee members serve as consultants to Cornell University and to the arXiv [Scientific Advisory Board](../../about/people/scientific_ad_board.md). All arXiv policy decisions are ultimately made by Cornell University.
