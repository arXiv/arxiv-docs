# Submissions in Languages Other Than English and Multiple-Language Submissions

We accept submissions in languages other than English but require that all submissions have an English version of the paper. By providing the entire paper in both languages — rather than the full paper being in a language other than English, with an English translation of only the abstract included — we make it possible for more people around the world to read and engage with your work. Please see our blog post about the [policy change to non-English paper submissions](https://blog.arxiv.org/2026/01/13/non-english-paper-submission-guidelines).


## Preparation of a multilingual paper

1. Please prepare your submission so that the English language version appears first, followed by the non-English language version.

2. You may submit your multilingual paper in the following formats: 
      1. **TeX/LaTeX:** You can upload and compile multiple .tex files together to create a single document. [See our TeX/LaTeX help pages](../submit_tex.md).
      
      2. **LaTeX with XeLaTeX:** You can use this compiler which makes it easier to process non-English language TeX sources. [See the compilation specifications for LaTeX with XeLaTeX](../00README.md#latex-with-xelatex).
      
      3. **PDF:** You may include all language versions of your paper in a single PDF file. (If you need an oversize exception for your PDF, please [contact us](../contact.md) with the submit-id after the submission is complete, and arXiv staff can assist you with your request.) [See our PDF submission guidelines](../submit_pdf.md).

3. Use the Comments metadata field to note the language of the main text of the submission or that there are multiple versions of the submission in different languages, for example:

>
>  \``` <br>
>  Comments: 24 pages, in French
>
>  \```
>

4. **Please note:** arXiv metadata, including abstracts, can only include a limited number of accented (non-ASCII) characters. For more information on our metadata requirements see: [Metadata for Required and Optional Fields](../prep.md).
