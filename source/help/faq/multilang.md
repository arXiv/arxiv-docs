# Submissions in Languages Other Than English and Multiple-Language Submissions

We accept submissions in languages other than English but do require
that all submissions have an English version of the abstract. The
principal reason for including an English abstract is to allow effective
search and keyword extraction over all submissions in arXiv.

## Preparation of a multilingual abstract

Please prepare English and alternate language abstracts so that one
follows the other, separated as shown below. If your abstract is long,
you may have to [contact us](../../help/contact.md) after the submission is complete
and arXiv staff can enter both versions. At this time, arXiv can only consider languages that do not involve extended UTF-8/UTF-16 characters. Do not try to use TeX or HTML formatting commands to separate the versions—the abstract should be as close to plain text (ASCII) as possible. Indicate separation as follows:

     English version of abstract for your important paper.

     -----

     Other language version of abstract for your important paper.

Note the blank lines before and after the separator (`-----`). The
abstract will then appear as follows on the web:

>
>  English version of abstract for your important paper.  
>  \-----  
>  Other language version of abstract for your important paper.

and as follows in the mailings:

>
>  English version of abstract for your important paper.
>  -----
>  Other language version of abstract for your important paper.

Please also use the Comments field to note the language of the main text
of the submission or that there are multiple versions of the submission
in different languages, for
example:


      ```
      Comments: 24 pages, in French
      ```

## Articles with multiple versions in different languages—TeX submissions

A specific utility is not available to provide alternate TeX versions for
different languages. If multiple language versions should be included in the final PDF,
please add all versions as toplevel files during the submission.

## Articles with multiple versions in different languages—PDF submissions

For PDF submissions, we currently only accept a single PDF file.
Please combine your different language versions of the paper into a
single PDF file for upload to arXiv.
