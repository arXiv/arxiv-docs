# Understanding arXiv Assigned DOIs

All articles submitted to arXiv are automatically assigned DOIs that correspond to their arXiv ID, and the associated article metadata is submitted to DataCite at no cost to the authors. This process enhances the discoverability of research articles across search engines by making the metadata available to the broader community in a reusable format.

## Why assign a DOI when my article has an arXiv ID?
DOIs are unique and persistent, just like the original arXiv ID number already assigned to every arXiv article. However, DOIs are used across many different platforms and they enable greater interoperability with other services.

## Will I still be able to provide an external DOI and/or journal reference with my article?

Yes, we will continue to support the existing journal reference and DOI metadata fields for linking to versions of an article outside arXiv. We strongly encourage authors to provide them when they become available.

## Will replacing an existing paper with a new version generate a new arXiv DOI?

Replacing an article with a new version will not generate a new DOI; however, the metadata associated with the existing DOI will be updated at DataCite to reflect the changes from the new version.

## How can I determine my article’s DOI?

An author can determine their article’s DOI by using the DOI prefix `https://doi.org/10.48550/` followed by the arXiv ID (replacing the colon with a period). For example, the arXiv ID arXiv:2202.01037 will translate to the DOI link `https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2202.01037`.

## Where will the arXiv DOI for my article link to?

The arXiv DOI will link to the arXiv abstract (/abs) page using the canonical form of the arXiv identifier, so it will always point to the latest version of the article, e.g.
`https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2201.NNNNN` → `https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.NNNNN`

## What is arXiv’s DOI prefix with DataCite?

10.48550
