# Contacting arXiv

## Technical queries

If you have questions about paper submission, accounts, and use of arXiv, please first review [help](index.md) and [FAQ](faq/index.md).

Contact our User Support team via the [arXiv user support portal](http://arxiv.org/support/general_help).

Note that our user support team typically operates 0900-1700 EST/EDT, Monday through Friday. Most requests are responded to by the end of the day, subject to staff availability and holidays.

To avoid a delay in receiving a response:

-   Please include all relevant details (especially submission or paper ids, URLs, etc.).

If you cannot access the portal you can also contact us by email at help@arxiv.org. If you do not get an automated email back that we have received your support request it is likely that your message was caught by our spam filter.



## Moderation queries

For questions about the status of your submission, or for [appeals](moderation/appeals.md), contact us through the [moderation support portal](https://arxiv.org/support/moderation_help).

-   Please include all relevant details (especially paper ids, former correspondence, submission summaries, etc.)
-   Please be *patient*, as moderation appeals are complicated and may take some time.

If you cannot access the portal you can contact us by email at moderation@arxiv.org. If you do not get an automated email back that we have received your support request it is likely that your message was caught by our spam filter.
