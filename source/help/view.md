# Viewing an article

Upon loading the abstract page for an article, you will find a number of
choices for download formats. These selections appear in the top right
of the page and look like:

Download:
---------

-   [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/9901001v3)
-   [PostScript](https://arxiv.org/ps/hep-th/9901001v3)
-   [Other formats](https://arxiv.org/format/hep-th/9901001v3)

For most articles **PDF** (Portable Document Format) will be available
as the top link. There may also be links to **PostScript**, **HTML**,
**Source** and **Other formats** depending on formats supplied by the
submitter of the article. See also [browser configuration
help](config_browser.md).

Other formats
-------------

The **Other formats** link provides access to a page listing all formats
available for an article, including a link to download the source files
for TeX/LaTeX articles. Look here if you would like to download in
formats such as

-   [PostScript](psvariants.md) at different resolutions (300 dpi, 600 dpi)
-   [PostScript using scalable fonts](type1linux.md)
-   DVI
-   Source files

The **Other formats** page also contains [instructions](https://arxiv.org/cookies) for
viewing/setting/changing the "Cookies" sent by your browser, which allow
changing your default preferred output format as desired.

If something does not work for you, then you probably need to configure
your web browser. With most browsers this is a simple matter of setting
a few items in a configuration menu. See the [browser configuration
help](config_browser.md).

If you choose the **Source** option, you will receive either a gzipped
TeX file, or a gzipped tar file if the paper has more than one file (if
there are figure files for instance). Usually you will not want to
select the **Source** option unless you have a specific need. Dealing
with the package you download may require `tar`, `gzip`, `TeX` and some
knowledge. We have some [unpacking instructions](unpack.md) explaining what
to do with this package.
