Served from the cloud
===============

For approximately the last 20 years, arXiv's services have been hosted at Cornell's IT facility in Ithaca New York. Recently we have begun to shift our services to a public cloud vendor.

We are doing this process little by little, starting with the browsing activities &ndash; PDF downloads, abstracts, listings, and search. The transition will happen later for account creation and maintenance, submitting and updating articles, and other pages.

While we are in the initial shakedown phase of this transition, which may last several months, you may see a small "Servied from the cloud" banner on some pages you're looking at. This indicates the page was served from our cloud infrastructure, rather than the servers at Cornell. We're showing this indicator so, in case there are issues, we will know whether a particular page came from the cloud host or Cornell.
