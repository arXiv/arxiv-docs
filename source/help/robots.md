Robots Beware
=============

### Indiscriminate automated downloads from this site are not permitted

We have limited server capacity and our first priority is to support
interactive use by human users. Several interfaces designed to
provide machine access to arXiv are provided. See our
[OAI-PMH](/help/oa/index.md), [arXiv API](/help/api/index.md) and [RSS](/help/rss.md)
documentation. There are also facilities for [bulk
data](/help/bulk_data.md) download, as well as guidelines for programmatic
[harvesting](/help/bulk_data.md#harvest).

Millions and billions of distinct URL's
---------------------------------------

This website is under all-too-frequent attack from
[robots](http://www.robotstxt.org/faq/what.html), spiders and
accelerators that mindlessly download every link encountered, ultimately
trying to access the entire database through the listings links.
Obviously, large search engines offer an invaluable service to web users
and we work with them to find efficient and effective ways to index
arXiv content. In many cases, however, we are subject to accidental
denial-of-service attacks by well-intentioned but thoughtless novices,
ignorant of common sense
[guidelines](http://www.robotstxt.org/guidelines.html).

Following the de-facto [standard for robot
exclusion](http://www.robotstxt.org/orig.html), this site has maintained
since early 1994 a file /[robots.txt](/robots.txt) that specifies those
URL's that are off-limits to robots (and this "Robots Beware" page was
originally posted March 1994).

Mindlessly downloading all of the URLs on this site will return
terabytes of data. This has very real cost to us in terms of bandwidth
consumed, and in terms of the responsiveness of our service.

arXiv monitors activity and will deny access to sites that violate these 
guidelines. Continued rapid-fire requests from
any site after access has been denied (i.e. with `403: Access denied`
HTTP response) will be interpreted as an attack; and we will respond
accordingly — without hesitation or warning.

If some specific application requires relaxation of the above
guidelines, [contact the arXiv administrators](/help/contact.md) *in
advance* of any attempted download.
