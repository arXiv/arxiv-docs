arXiv mirror sites
==================

The mirror network has been shut down as of September 15th, 2024.

The arXiv mirrors were begun as an attempt to provide better local access to the arXiv corpus to facilitate speed during the nascent modern internet. The mirror network was significantly expanded in the late 1990's and, at the time, was heavily used. Geographic locality is now much less useful than it was when the mirror network was established. Now, most users geographically close to mirrors, perhaps in neighboring countries, have better access to the main site than to a "nearby" mirror. These read-only mirrors took significant effort of both arXiv staff and hosting volunteer institutions to maintain, implement and update. 

arXiv has transitioned to a cloud-centric system for our content delivery. Therefore the intended purpose of the mirrors is no longer relevant.
