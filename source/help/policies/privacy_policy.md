arXiv Privacy Policy
======================

The following privacy notice describes what information we collect from you when you visit arXiv.org and how we use this information. Please read this privacy notice carefully so that you understand our privacy practices.

## Effective Date of Privacy Notice

The privacy notice was last revised on 2024-12-12.

## Introduction

arXiv, a service of Cornell University, creates, hosts, and permanently preserves a free, open-access archive of scholarly articles in specific fields of research. Articles posted to arXiv are made publicly available for review and use by the academic community, and beyond. Articles hosted on arXiv are assigned Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs), are indexed in third-party search engines, and may be cited in other works. In addition, arXiv takes steps to ensure research integrity and originality of submitted content. Therefore, each version of a paper (including rejected papers) is considered a permanent part of the scientific record and may not be removed.

Consistent with arXiv’s purpose and mission, when you choose to submit an article to arXiv, you acknowledge and agree that it is worthy of archival preservation as described herein, has lasting value for research as well as for understanding current and historical trends, and that the article,_including the names and affiliations of authors and co-authors, if provided,and the submitter’s email address_ will be permanently preserved online for the purpose of fulfilling arXiv’s legitimate interests in archiving, research, and statistical recordkeeping in the public interest. In doing so, we make reasonable efforts, taking into account the content and condition of the material, to avoid putting personal information online that may cause damage or distress to living individuals.

The following privacy notice describes the Personal Data we collect from you when you visit arXiv.org and how we use this information. For the purposes of this notice, Personal Data is defined as information relating to an identified or identifiable individual; an identifiable individual is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, by use of any identifier or characteristic specific to that individual. Please read this privacy notice carefully so that you understand our privacy practices. For additional information concerning Cornell University’s privacy practices, please visit the University Privacy [website](https://privacy.cornell.edu/). We reserve the right to change this policy at any time to reflect changes in the law, our data collection and use practices, the features of our services, or advances in technology. Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of arXiv following the posting of changes to this policy will be deemed to mean you understand the applicability of those changes.

## Types of Personal Data arXiv May Collect About You

When you use our site to access our online content, create a user account, upload material to our website, submit feedback or initiate a help request, contribute to our mission by donating to arXiv, participate in our webinars, or sign up to receive arXiv news or participate in other activities sponsored or hosted by arXiv, we collect personal information about you, as described below.

We may collect the following information based on how you engage with arXiv:

## How arXiv May Use Your Personal Data

arXiv uses the Personal Data collected for the following purposes:

- **Scholarly paper and article submission, hosting, and archiving** – In the content submission and moderation process we link user accounts, authorship, and submitted content to track and process submissions, as follows:
    - Article metadata provided by submitter, including author list, author affiliation (if provided), and submitter name is displayed with the article posting, email announcement of articles, and bulk metadata access via API.
    - Users who submit articles or other content to arXiv must ensure that they have the right to distribute the work and that inclusion of the article in arXiv does not violate the rights of any person or entity, including privacy rights, or the submission may be removed.
    - The email address that was used to upload each submission is viewable by registered arXiv users to give users the ability to send feedback on papers to the submitter and to help users [contact eligible arXiv endorsers](https://arxiv.org/help/endorsement#request) in order to make their own submissions.
    - For more information, see [Submission Guidelines](https://arxiv.org/help/submit), [Author Registration](https://arxiv.org/help/registerhelp), [arXiv Submittal Agreement](https://arxiv.org/help/policies/submission_agreement), and [arXiv Moderation](https://arxiv.org/help/moderation).

- **Legal** – We may have a legal obligation to handle your Personal Data when necessary to comply with applicable law, or to enforce legal rights or contractual commitments you have made, or terms of use to which you have agreed.

- **Public interest** – We may handle your Personal Data when necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety and security of Cornell University, arXiv, our users, or others.

- Your **consent**, in limited circumstances where other bases are not recognized. Generally, we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your Personal Data, unless it is specifically required by your jurisdiction, such as for sending fundraising, marketing, or other optional communications or for collecting special category or sensitive information on an optional basis for research purposes. When we process your Personal Data on the basis of consent, you are able to remove your consent at any time. You can do this by contacting: [privacy@arxiv.org]. 

We will retain your Personal Data for as long as needed to meet these objectives and to ensure compliance with our legal obligations.

### Location of Processing and International Data Transfers

Cornell University is located in the United States and is subject to U.S. and New York law, which may not provide the same level of protection as the laws in your jurisdiction. If you use arXiv, you understand and agree that you will be transmitting your Personal Data to personnel in the United States and your data generally will be hosted on U.S. servers, and might be transmitted to or accessed from the United States or other jurisdictions outside of the Relevant Country when necessary for business or other valid purposes, and you consent to the transfer of such data to the U.S. for processing by us in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

### Rights You May Have and How to Exercise Them

Upon your reasonable and good faith request, we will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your Personal Data as part of our In-scope Processing, to the extent required and in accordance with Relevant Law. In certain cases, you may also have a right under Relevant Law, with respect to your Personal Data collected and used in our In-scope Processing, to:

- obtain a copy of your Personal Data in an easily accessible format;

- request that we correct or update any of your Personal Data that is inaccurate; 

- restrict or limit the ways in which we use your Personal Data;

If you wish to exercise your rights or have other questions or concerns related to your rights under Relevant Law, please fill out a data privacy Request Form. To avoid taking action regarding your Personal Data at the direction of someone other than you, we may ask you for information verifying your identity.

If our In-scope Processing as to your Personal Data is solely based on your consent, in certain cases you may also have the right under a Relevant Law to withdraw your consent to our processing. If you withdraw your consent to the use or sharing of your Personal Data for the purposes set out in these Disclosures, or otherwise limit our use of your Personal Data or request its deletion, we may no longer be able to provide you some or all of the related services.

Please note that, in certain cases, we may continue to process your Personal Data after you have withdrawn consent or requested that we delete your Personal Data, if we have a legal basis to do so. For example, we may retain certain data if we need to do so to comply with an independent legal obligation, if we still need the data for the lawful purposes for which we obtained the data, or if it is necessary to do so to pursue our legitimate interest in conducting research in the public interest, subject to appropriate privacy safeguards.
