#Fonts

arXiv uses two main typefaces from the Freight family, and two accent typefaces. The Freight family draw from Cornell University’s branding and connect us stylistically with our parent organization. The accent typefaces add variation and interest, and are a bridge to our retro 90's roots.

##Primary Typefaces
FreightText pro is our primary typeface. With high legibility and a classic, sophisticated look it is the workhorse of the arXiv look and feel:

FreightSans Pro elegantly complements it's serif sibling font. The clean lines of this sans serif face lend themselves well to larger uses like titles, and special use cases like callouts, sidebars, and other secondary content.

IBM Plex Sans Condensed is used for special cases where a bold face is called for. Special headings, annotations, limited horizontal space, or labels are all good candidates for IBM Plex Sans Condensed:

Larabiefont, in combination with Xenara, is customized as the basis of our logo. These fonts are used in logo lockups, logo extensions, and in the identies for special partnerships.
