#Brand Pillars
arXiv is an indispensable tool for the scientific community. Nevertheless it can be difficult to describe. These brand pillars drive our messaging.

##Mission
arXiv is an open platform where researchers can share and discover new, relevant, emerging science and establish their contribution to advancing research.

##Vision
Our vision is for all researchers around the world to have immediate, free and open access to all established and emerging research in their field.

##Core Value
Our core value can be summed up in just two words: *arXiv Connects*

arXiv is a place of connection, linking together people and ideas, and connecting them with the world of open science.

> **“arXiv is often the first place where researchers take action in open science.”**
>
> —Dr. Hideaki Takeda, Professor, National Institute of Informatics

This core value is reflected across arXiv's brand, from the intertwining arms of the chi in our logo, to our tagline, typographic treatments, tone of voice, and messaging. The world has changed since arXiv was born in 1991, but it remains your connection to open science.

##We are a community
Our community is diverse and global, and **our communications aim to be inclusive and accessible**. Our authors, readers, institutional members, collaborators, moderators, and more are not passive recipients of arXiv’s services—they *are* arXiv. We welcome participation from diverse communities and our communications reflect our inclusive ethos.

##Priorities

- **arXiv is reliable.** arXiv’s strong technical, funding, and governance foundation reliably connects readers and authors to open science, all year long, across the globe. A significant part of this strength is drawn from our relationships with other organizations in scholarly communications.
- **arXiv is an essential research tool.** 2+ million articles contributed. 2.2+ billion downloads. Countless discoveries, connections, and synergies have been catalyzed in arXiv’s 30+ year history.
- **We are primed for growth and innovation.** Ideas abound, and we have the structures and systems in place to prioritize and execute high impact innovation.
