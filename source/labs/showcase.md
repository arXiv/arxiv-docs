# arXivLabs: Showcase
![arXiv Labs icon](images/smileybones-labs-icon.png){.mkd-img-thumb width=100 align=right alt='a bubbling beaker with a smiling face and crossedbones behind it' role=presentation}

arXiv is surrounded by a community of researchers and developers working at the cutting edge of information science and technology.

While the arXiv team is focused on our core mission—providing rapid dissemination of research findings at no cost to readers and submitters—we are excited to be experimenting with a small number of collaborators on projects that add value for our stakeholders and advance research.

Interested in proposing a new arXiv Labs project? Please [use our support portal](https://arxiv-org.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/6) to fill out a proposal, or ask questions.

Below are some of the projects that our collaborators have done.
___
## arXiv Bibliographic Explorer

##Hugging Face Spaces

![Hugging Face icon](images/huggingface-logo.png){.mkd-border align=left width=100 alt='a decorative icon of the Hugging Face labs project' role=presentation}

Collaborators: **Abubakar Abid**, **Omar Sanseviero**, **Ahsen Khaliq**, and the **[Hugging Face team](https://huggingface.co/huggingface)**

 Hugging Face Spaces includes links to demos created by the community or the authors themselves. By going to the Demos tab of your favorite paper in the arXiv categories of computer science, statistics, or electrical engineering and systems science, you can find links to open-source demos and try them out immediately. With Spaces, Hugging Face users can share, explore, discuss models, and build interactive applications that enable anyone with a browser to try them out without having to run any code. These demos are built using open-source tools such as the Gradio and Streamlit Python libraries, and leverage models and datasets available on the Hugging Face Hub.

##IArxiv
![IArxiv icon](images/iarxiv-logo.jpg){.mkd-border align=left width=100 alt='a decorative icon of the IArxiv labs project' role=presentation}

[About IArxiv](https://iarxiv.org/about), [Sign up for IArxiv](https://iarxiv.org/home)

Collaborators: **Ezequiel Alvarez**, ICAS, Professor at UNSAM, **Cesar Miquel**, Easytech, and the **[Easytech team](https://iarxiv.org/about)**

IArxiv allows readers to receive, by email, daily arXiv papers in a growing number of categories sorted by artificial intelligence according to their preferences. IArxiv learns each reader’s preferences first by fetching previous papers authored by the reader. Then, those preferences are updated over time based on the papers opened by that reader within the emails or on iarxiv.org. IArxiv runs an unsupervised Machine Learning algorithm, called LDA, to extract which topics are present in each paper, and in which proportions, to construct a vector of topics for each reader.

Collaborators: **Josh Nicholson**, **Domenic Rosati**.

Scite is a platform for discovering and evaluating scientific articles via Smart Citations. Smart Citations allow users to see how a publication has been cited by providing the context of the citation and a classification describing whether it provides supporting or contrasting evidence for the cited claim. With the Scite Smart Labs project, viewers can see this information directly on the abstracts page.

Collaborators: **Ben Firshman** and **the Replicate team**

Machine learning is still extremely hard to use. Research is typically published as a PDF, with scraps of code on GitHub and weights on Google Drive.
