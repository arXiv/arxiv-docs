# Submit your project to arXivLabs

_arXiv Labs is back from vacation._ As of December 2022 we are open for reviewing new proposals. Please <a href="https://arxiv-org.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/6">use our support portal</a> to fill out a proposal, or ask questions.

Visit [Labs criteria](criteria.md) to learn more about the criteria for Labs projects.

It is not necessary to be part of a Labs project to use the arXiv APIs. Many projects that use APIs and other methods to access arXiv's metadata, full text, or source files are **not** arXivLabs projects. Learn more about [arXiv API access and data usage here.](https://arxiv.org/help/api/)

arXiv welcomes anyone, from single individuals to large companies, to contribute ideas and propose their project for arXivLabs. All projects must abide by arXiv’s values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.
