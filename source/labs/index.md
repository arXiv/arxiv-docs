## What are arXiv Labs?

arXiv Labs are a way for the community to contribute new, useful features to arXiv. These integrations are available to readers through a series of tabs at the bottom of the abstract page.

Useful features include bibliographic info, demos, and links to code. Explore arXiv abstract pages or the [Labs Showcase](showcase.md) to see examples.

If you have questions about collaborating with arXiv on something that is not aligned with arXiv Labs, contact us through our [user support portal](https://arxiv-org.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1). If you need information on how to submit a paper to arXiv, please visit our [help pages](../help/index.md).

## arXiv Labs Hiatus

We are temporarily pausing new arXiv Labs proposals at the moment while our dev team focuses on our current top priority - modernizing and moving arXiv’s systems to the cloud. Please note that this “hiatus” does not affect any current arXiv Labs or Labs proposals that have already been submitted through the arXiv Labs support portal and are awaiting approval. [Please read our blog post](https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/2025/11/12/arxiv-labs-is-pausing-new-proposals) for more information.
