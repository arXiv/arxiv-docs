## 0.      arXiv Organizational Structure - Definitions



The **arXiv Steward**, who is Dean and Provost of Cornell Tech, holds the final responsibility for all aspects of arXiv.  



**arXiv Faculty Director**

The arXiv Faculty Director (FD) is appointed by and reports to the Steward, who may consult broadly with arXiv stakeholders (e.g., advisory committee members) on matters related to appointment, reappointment, and performance of the FD. The Faculty Director holds responsibility and decision-making authority for all day-to-day operations, functions and activities of arXiv, including supervising arXiv staff and managing the arXiv budget. The FD leads the Executive Committee (EC) and is presiding chair of the arXiv Advisory Board (AAB). Upon recommendation of the Faculty Director, the Steward appoints an Associate Faculty Director to assist the Faculty Director and broaden the faculty support base of arXiv.



The Faculty Director will engage in activities such as:


<ul>
<li>managing relations with external parties and fundraising for arXiv</li>

<li>ensuring arXiv works successfully towards its mission, in compliance with its operating principles</li>

<li>establishing long- and short-term goals for arXiv, and optimizing the use of staff and budget towards achieving those goals</li>

<li>keeping the Advisory Councils informed about progress towards achieving the stated goals</li>
</ul>




**arXiv Executive Committee**

The Executive Committee is the leadership team within arXiv that supports the Faculty Director in executing their responsibilities. The Executive committee consists of the Faculty Director, Associate Faculty Director and leadership within arXiv staff selected by the Faculty Director.





**arXiv Advisory Board**

The arXiv Advisory Board (AAB) is a group of experts who lend their skills, expertise and guidance in support of the mission of arXiv; the Faculty Director is the presiding chair of the AAB. The arXiv Advisory Board includes members of the Executive Committee and the Advisory Council Chairs, and may be augmented by experts (see 6.5.4). The arXiv Advisory Board is the main point of contact between Executive Committee and the Advisory Councils, tasked with:


<ul>
<li>ensuring efficient exchange of information between Councils and Executive Committee</li>

<li>coordinating the advising work of the councils; this includes hearing from the Executive Committee about upcoming issues and informing the Executive Committee of upcoming matters relevant to arXiv stakeholder communities.</li>
</ul>
