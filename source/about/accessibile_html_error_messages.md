These errors are notifying us that the author of the paper did not use a TeX/LaX package that we fully support. 


## For authors

After you have submitted your paper and it has been processed, you will receive a link to preview the HTML version of your paper. You may see an error message alerting you that the TeX/LaTeX packages used to format your paper are not fully supported by our conversion process. Therefore your paper may display red TeX/LaTeX code and other formatting irregularities. 

Please see an example of a HTML processing error below:
