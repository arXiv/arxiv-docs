arXiv Business Planning Update
------------------------------

July 2010

Since announcing our collaborative business model in January 2010, we
have secured pledges from 85 institutions, totaling to $302,000 in
contributions. We have been encouraged with the international support
that represents Australia, Canada, China, Germany, India, Israel, Japan,
Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The Joint
Information Systems Committee (JISC) Collections has facilitated the
coordination of contributions from the UK academic community and we are
in the process of making a similar arrangement for Germany working with
the German National Library of Science and Technology (TIB) and the
Helmholtz Association (HGF). We are especially interested in increasing
our outreach in France and Italy as these countries represent large user
groups.

As described in the [arXiv business model white
paper](whitepaper.md), our target for CY2010 was $100,000 and
we now anticipate reaching our CY 2012 contribution goal by the end of
this year. The [CY2010 budget](2010_CY_arXiv_budget.pdf) reflects the
current staffing configuration and anticipated computer and staffing
expenses for calendar year 2010. We will post the actual calendar year
2010 spending at the end of the year. We are working on developing a
roadmap for upgrading the underlying technology in order to continue
innovation through new features as well as achieving cost efficiencies
and further reliability through advanced architectural elements.

Complementing these short-term business planning efforts, we formed a
Sustainability Advisory Group, which will provide an essential
consultative role in developing diverse sustainability strategies for
this critical international resource. The charge and composition of the
advisory group is posted at:
[http://arxiv.org/help/support/sustainability\_advisory\_group](sustainability_advisory_group.md).

Based on requests from several publishers and societies with
publications in physics and mathematics, we recently started exploring
how to expand our current institutional contribution model to invite
support from relevant publishers. We are currently holding conference
calls and gathering input from a selected group of publishers to
understand how we can include them in our collaborative business
modeling process.

More information about our sustainability and business planning efforts
is available at [http://arxiv.org/help/support](../../help/support.md).

We thank all our supporters and welcome questions and suggestions.
