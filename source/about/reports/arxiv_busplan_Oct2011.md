arXiv Business Planning Update
------------------------------

October 2011

**Governance Planning Grant from Simons Foundation**

The Simons Foundation has provided a $60,000 planning grant to support
the development of a governance model that will guide arXiv's transition
from an exclusive initiative of Cornell University Library (CUL) to a
collaboratively governed, community supported resources. Please see the
[press
release](http://news.library.cornell.edu/news/111025/arXiv_governance)
for more information.

**arXiv's 20th Anniversary Celebration at Cornell**

On September 23, 2011, we commemorated the 20th anniversary of arXiv
with a local celebration that included two meetings and a public talk by
Paul Ginsparg. [arXiv Scientific Advisory
Board](../../about/people/scientific_ad_board.md) members met to discuss the role,
structure, and composition of the Board; moderation issues such as new
moderator recruitment and submission quality criteria; and the ongoing
business modeling and organizational streamlining efforts. We also
hosted a meeting with the representatives from several publishers and
societies that are interested in Cornell's sustainability planning
efforts. The goal of the forum was to discuss the feasibility and
desirability of establishing a research and innovation collaboration in
support of arXiv. Potential collaboration areas discussed included
strategies to improve crosslinking, supporting lifecycle of research
materials and version control, supplementary material support, author
authentication and verification, and automated metadata exchange.
Included in the meeting were representatives from American Mathematical
Association, American Physical Society, American Institute of Physics,
Institute of Physics, Institute of Mathematical Statistics, Springer,
Elsevier, and Wiley. As we move forward with our discussions, we will
make an effort to bring in other significant international
publisher/society partners to this discussion.

**News from the Operations Front**

We continue working with the CERN team to migrate arXiv to use the
Invenio platform for our access interface. Developers working with the
ADS, INSPIRE and arXiv projects met face-to-face in September at the 5th
Summit of Information Providers in Astronomy, Astrophysics and High
Energy Physics
([AAHEP5](http://indico.cern.ch/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=128826)).
They have together decided on changes to the web framework that Invenio
uses that will better support functionality that ADS and arXiv require
while also providing a good development path for INSPIRE and other
projects using Invenio.

arXiv now provides a login service for INSPIRE that facilitates sharing
of author identity information between the two systems. When arXiv users
login via this mechanism the list of articles on arXiv they have
authored is automatically transferred to INSPIRE and used to seed the
INSPIRE article claiming service.

The arXiv team has completed a preliminary user study to inform
Invenio-related web interface changes. We have also initiated a review
of arXiv user guides and help pages.

We continue to work closely with Paul Ginsparg to transition his
moderation oversight role into regular arXiv administration processes
managed by the Library. Thorsten Schwander, who has worked with arXiv
for over fifteen years in various capacities, has assumed additional
responsibilities in this regard.

**Institutional Contributions Update**

Through October 15, 2011, 129 institutions in 16 countries have pledged
their support, totaling $382,000 of contributions for 2011. We
gratefully acknowledge the contributions of supporting institutions:
[arXiv 2010 Supporters](2010_supporters.md) and [arXiv 2011
Supporters](2011_supporters.md). The budget information for
arXiv is available here: [CY2010 expenses and
revenues](http://tinyurl.com/3wu56ur) and CY2011 budget
projection.

In January, we will perform an analysis of the 2011 download activity in
order to determine the top 200 constituents. Based on our sampling thus
far, we do not expect any significant variations from the 2010 list. By
February 2012, we will contact each institution (or their
representative) in the list in regard 2012 support. As a new feature, we
will provide a breakdown of institutional downloads by subject area
(Astrophysics, HEP, Mathematics, etc.). Multiple institutions have
requested this level of information and we have updated our analytics to
provide. We welcome your suggestions for additional metrics.

**Communication**

The arXiv sustainability initiative's website is
[http://arxiv.org/help/support](../../about/governance.md), including the quarterly
updates. You are also welcome to send your questions and input to
<support@arxiv.org>. We have recently created an announcement email list
for updates about arXiv support efforts, and we have transferred all of
our current contacts to that list. If you received this update directly,
you are already subscribed. Others wishing to receive quarterly updates
via email are encouraged to join the list. Instructions are included
below this update.

In August 2011, we held three conference calls and had an opportunity to
talk with 33 colleagues on various issues related to arXiv. We will hold
three open conference calls in November (to accommodate different time
zones) and invite you to join one:

-   November 15, Tuesday, 6am EST
-   November 21, Monday, noon, EST
-   November 29, Tuesday, 4pm EST

We are very interested in understanding different perspectives on our
business modeling efforts and welcome suggestions, criticisms, and
encouragement! Please register for these conference calls at:
[ihttps://cornell.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV\_09xOd4Uoqc1di84](https://cornell.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_09xOd4Uoqc1di84)

We thank all our supporters and welcome questions and suggestions.
