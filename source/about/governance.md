Governance of arXiv is led by the Leadership Team with guidance from the arXiv [Science Advisory Council](people/science_advisory_council.md), [Institutions Advisory Council](people/institutions_advisory_council.md), and [Editorial Advisory Council](people/editorial_advisory_council.md).

The arXiv team, consisting of the [arXiv Leadership
Team](people/leadership_team.md) and [arXiv staff](people/staff.md), is responsible for the
