# Science Advisory Council

The Science Advisory Council represents the scientific and research community of arXiv, 
that is, those who create valuable content and who systematically read this content. The 
Science Advisory Council provides advice and guidance to the Faculty Director on 
issues guiding the sustainability and success of arXiv, including those pertaining to the 
intellectual oversight of arXiv. Examples include: mission, vision, strategy, budget, 
significant expansions, high-level issues related to standards, expansion in new 
fields/sections, novelties and changes in the production and dissemination of scholarly 
works, impact across disciplines, relation with the community they represent, authors 
and readers needs, etc.
