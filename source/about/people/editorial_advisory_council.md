# Editorial Advisory Council

The role of the Editorial Advisory Council, also known as the Editorial Board, is both
advisory and operational. It codifies the top-level standards, rules, and procedures of
arXiv’s moderation/editorial system and the boards and committees that execute and
govern it. Its purpose is to establish an orderly process of submission, moderation, and
discussion of content to serve arXiv’s mission. It provides transparent, fair, and
reproducible procedures for arXiv, that leave room for editorial judgement of content. The chairs of the Section Editorial Committees are the regular members of the Editorial Advisory Council.
