# Institutional Submission Data and Membership Dashboard FAQ

Thank you for supporting arXiv through membership!

arXiv’s goal is to provide our members with the data they need to evaluate arXiv’s impact and value to their institutions, and, as such, one of the membership benefits we provide is in-depth institutional data in a customized dashboard.

Learn more about the data arXiv collects and how we share it with the public and our members in the frequently asked questions below.

## What data does arXiv collect to share with members?

arXiv's corpus consists of almost 3 million submissions - that's a lot of data! The unique data that we collect to share with arXiv members is known as institutional submission data. arXiv determines which submissions are linked to an institution through authorship. We track that data and share it with our institutional members so that they can have a better sense of how their students, staff, and researchers are sharing their work through arXiv.

Submission statistics are available to the member representatives of active arXiv member institutions and consortia. Emails with password protected links are sent to each member representative in the spring. If you are a member representative at an active member organization and you did not receive your link, please contact [membership@arXiv.org](mailto:membership@arXiv.org). Not a member yet?

## How does arXiv collect and analyze institutional data?

Tracking institutional submission data is harder than it looks! arXiv has employed different methods to do so since we began providing this data in 2021.

In 2020, members requested that arXiv start tracking and sharing institutional data. In 2021, we tracked and shared this data using Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG). In 2022, when MAG was deprecated, submission data was provided by  [Scopus](https://www.elsevier.com/solutions/scopus), the curated abstract and citation database operated by Elsevier. From 2022 to 2024, Scopus used [arXiv’s open APIs](https://info.arxiv.org/help/api/index.html) to collect and process the data, and returned it to arXiv to share with members. Scopus generously provided this service free of charge.

For 2024 submissions and beyond, arXiv is now producing the institutional affiliation data in-house. While the exact methodology may evolve over time, our current approach relies on detecting institutional affiliation from macros in the LaTeX source and other metadata. It is our hope that bringing the institutional affiliation detection in-house will allow us to better address member institutions' questions about data accuracy, transparency, and availability, and enable arXiv to evolve the data collection and reporting process to support our member institutions' needs.

Beginning in 2025, members may notice slight discrepancies between the number of articles they see now and what they saw in previous years due to this change in methodology. If you have questions or concerns about the data presented in your membership dashboard, please contact us at [membership@arXiv.org](mailto:membership@arXiv.org).


## Why does arXiv collect this data?

arXiv provides usage data to member institutions as a member benefit so that they can better understand the value arXiv brings to their institution. Usage data is a component of [arXiv's membership program](https://info.arxiv.org/about/membership.html), which provides approximately 60% of arXiv's operating budget.


## How does sharing submission data help arXiv members and librarians?


Submission data helps librarians understand the research activities taking place across their campuses. arXiv’s membership dashboard helps members track changes in their institution’s research outputs posted to arXiv, identifying arXiv usage in different subject categories over time. The insights can be used to report on progress towards open access and other key strategic goals. They can also inform future planning.


## How can I find and access my institution's submission statistics?

You now need an arXiv account to access your institution’s submission statistics.

Submission statistics are provided to each member institution through a customized arXiv membership dashboard. Statistics were formerly shared via a password protected link - we updated our system in favor of security, flexibility, and (eventual) speed of service.

If you are the member representative of your institutions, you should have received an email invite with instructions on how to access the new member dashboard. Never received the email or need help accessing your dashboard? Email [membership@arXiv.org](mailto:membership@arXiv.org).

## Does my institution's membership dashboard include a list of papers submitted by authors at my institutions?


At this time, lists of papers submitted are only available to Champion members. To learn more about becoming a Champion member, please see our [membership information](https://info.arxiv.org/about/membership.html) or contact membership@arXiv.org.


## Does my institution's membership dashboard include download statistics?


arxiv.org receives millions of downloads every month - you can see our monthly download rates [here.](https://arxiv.org/stats/monthly_downloads) While downloads are an important part of what makes arXiv valuable to researchers and institutions, arXiv no longer provides download statistics by institution. 

The “work from anywhere” shift that began in 2020 in response to the Covid-19 pandemic has continued - arXiv readers, authors, and researchers increasingly work from home or remote locations, rather than on campus. Because of this, institutional download statistics, which arXiv formerly calculated using an institution’s IP addresses, are no longer an accurate representation of which institutions’ students and researchers are using arXiv, nor is it a complete picture of the value an institution derives from arXiv.

Additionally, our members and users expressed a growing interest and need for submission statistics, especially as the rate of submissions has grown over time. Because of this, we now base our membership tiers on institutional submission rates, and make submission data available through our membership dashboards. arXiv’s overall monthly submission rates are also publicly available [here](https://arxiv.org/stats/monthly_submissions).


## When can I see my institution's updated usage statistics?


You have access to your institution’s membership dashboard year-round. Currently, arXiv provides the last three years of submission statistics, and we update the membership dashboards every year. In February, we collect and parse the data we have for the previous year, and the dashboards are updated once arXiv has confirmed the data’s accuracy and updated the membership dashboard.

As we have newly switched to parsing our own data, there may be some delays in information release as we improve our data accuracy and workflows. In 2025, our membership dashboards were updated in August. In 2026, our goal is to update the membership dashboards in the first quarter of the new year (Jan - March). Eventually, our goal with our new dashboard design is to have the ability to provide live, of-the-minute usage data to the public and our members.


## Can I share my membership dashboard with others?


Yes! Our new dashboards provide an easy and secure way to share your membership data with interested colleagues across your organization.

When you go to the [member login page](https://members.arxiv.org) and sign in to your dashboard, you will see a “Share” button in the top right corner of your dashboard. Provide your colleague’s name and email, and send the invitation. They will be invited to create an arXiv account to access your institution’s dashboard. If you have a large group of colleagues who need access to your data, we can help you manage your dashboard access. Contact us at membership@arxiv.org.
