## A practical forum, free and open to all
Hosted by arXiv, this half-day online forum will center the experiences of academic researchers with disabilities who face barriers to accessing and reading papers. The forum will be useful for people across the academic authoring and publishing ecosystem who are committed to making accessible research papers a reality.

**Accessible research papers is a goal within reach.** There are a lot of resources and smart people working on solutions. Together, we can chart a path towards fully accessible research papers, and leave with practical next steps for our own organizations.

## An Inclusive Event
We want to make this forum as inclusive as we can. *Please note that ASL interpreters will be present throughout all segments.* When registering, please let us know if additional accommodations will help you participate fully.

### Volunteer opportunity
Are you a fast note taker? Want to get involved and help make the forum even more inclusive? arXiv is looking for five or six individuals to take live notes, each for a portion of the forum. They will complement Zoom captioning and other efforts, and make the forum just that much more inclusive and easy to follow.
