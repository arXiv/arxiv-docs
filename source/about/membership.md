# Membership

Who makes arXiv possible? You - our members.  
As the world’s premier open access research sharing platform, arXiv was founded for scientists, by scientists. arXiv will always be for research and for education - not for profit. That’s why we rely on our members - universities, libraries, research institutes, and labs - to support our mission with funding, expertise, and advocacy.

## How does arXiv membership work?

arXiv membership offers your institution a high value, budget-conscious option to serve your scholarly community while supporting open science. arXiv is always free for researchers to read and submit to, and membership rates with arXiv are well below traditional subscriptions and open access fees.

arXiv member institutions not only help support arXiv and open science for their researchers, they receive public recognition, institutional usage statistics and eligibility to serve in arXiv's governance. The arXiv membership program is designed to be inclusive and flexible, with membership options to fit the needs of institutions across the globe. Members are an important part of arXiv’s sustainable funding - arXiv members make up more than 50% of arXiv’s operating budget!

## arXiv membership options

The arXiv membership program consists of Standard membership, All Star membership (new in 2025!), Champion membership, and Community membership.

Standard and All Star memberships are based on [your institution’s global arXiv rank](reports/2024_institution_submissions.md), which is based on how many submissions to arXiv researchers affiliated with your institutions make every year, averaged over the past three years.


| Membership Tier | Rank | All Star Membership Rate |
|-----------------|:----------|:--------------------|   
| Top 100 | 1 - 100 | $6,500 |   
| Frequent | 101 - 500 | $3,250 |   
| Regular | 501 + | $1,400 |

_All membership rates are in USD and can be paid by wire, credit card, or check. [See payment instructions here](arXiv-payment-instructions-2025.pdf)._

Is your institution part of a consortia? Email [arXiv Membership](mailto:membership@arxiv.org) to learn more about how your consortia can support arXiv and receive a 10% membership rate discount for all consortia members.

## Supporting arXiv above and beyond: arXiv Champions and All Stars

Is your institution an advocate of open access and a thought leader in scholarly communications? Choose to support arXiv with an upgraded membership! 

**arXiv Champions**

Champion memberships with arXiv are for top research institutions whose goal is to lead the global research community in innovation, education, and promoting open science. With a membership contribution of $10,000, Champion members make a strong statement of their support of arXiv and equitable access to open science. Champions receive a more in-depth user stats dashboard and are featured more prominently on arXiv's membership page and in arXiv's digital communications.

**arXiv All Stars**

"All Star" membership with arXiv is a new option for institutions who would like to support arXiv above and beyond their standard membership rate. By giving an extra percentage above standard membership, All Star members support arXiv, their researchers and scientific discovery by giving above and beyond to open access initiatives. arXiv All Star members are highlighted on arXiv's membership page and featured more prominently in arXiv digital communications and newsletters.

## Give what you can: arXiv Community members

Is your institution using arXiv primarily for downloading and reading papers, rather than submitting? Or, is your institution significantly resource-limited, but you would still like to support arXiv and open science? Maybe your budget this year is a little tighter than usual. Become an arXiv Community member! Join the arXiv community by giving what you can and choosing your contribution level.
