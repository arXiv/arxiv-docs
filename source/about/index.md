# About arXiv

arXiv is a curated research-sharing platform open to anyone. As a pioneer in digital open access, arXiv.org now hosts more than two million scholarly articles in eight subject areas, curated by our strong community of volunteer moderators.

arXiv offers researchers a broad range of services: article submission, compilation, production, retrieval, search and discovery, web distribution for human readers, and API access for machines, together with content curation and preservation. Our emphasis on openness, collaboration, and scholarship provide the strong foundation on which arXiv thrives.

arXiv currently serves the fields of physics, mathematics, computer science, quantitative biology, quantitative finance, statistics, electrical engineering and systems science, and economics. arXiv was founded by Paul Ginsparg in 1991 and is now maintained and operated by [Cornell Tech](https://www.tech.cornell.edu/).

Operations are maintained by the [arXiv Leadership Team](people/leadership_team.md) and arXiv staff at Cornell. Governance of arXiv is led by the Leadership Team with guidance from the arXiv Scientific Advisory Board and the arXiv Member Advisory Board. arXiv is a community-supported resource funded by [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/), the [Simons Foundation](https://www.simonsfoundation.org), [member institutions](ourmembers.md), and [donors](give.md).

Registered users may [submit articles](../help/submit.md) to be announced by arXiv. There are no fees or costs for article submission. Submissions to arXiv are subject to a [moderation process](../help/moderation/index.md) that classifies material as topical to the subject area and checks for scholarly value. Material is not peer-reviewed by arXiv - the contents of arXiv submissions are wholly the responsibility of the submitter and are presented “as is” without any warranty or guarantee. By hosting works and other materials on this site, arXiv, Cornell University, and their agents do not in any way convey implied approval of the assumptions, methods, results, or conclusions of the work.
