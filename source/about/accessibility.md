# Accessibility at arXiv

Accessibility and access are not the same. Accessibility *ensures access regardless of disability*, and research is not truly open without it.
{ .intro }

arXiv can contribute to making academic publishing more accessible in several ways:  We can make the content we host readable by screen readers and other technologies; we can promote and support discussions in the scientific community around the accessibility of research outputs; and we can help elevate the voices of scientists who directly face these barriers. Our current projects reflect these goals.

## Our Accessibility Projects

### Papers in HTML Format
The request to offer arXiv-hosted papers in HTML format comes directly from scientists with disabilities who face barriers to accessing the research they need. Learn why adding [papers in HTML format](accessible_HTML.md) to our existing PDF and source options is important for accessibility.


### Accessibility Research
The research content hosted by arXiv is not fully accessible to everyone due to disabilities and other barriers. Learn about the steps arXiv is taking to make open science truly open and accessible.

- Read the [Accessibility Report](accessibility_research_report.md) that led to the development of HTML formatted papers.
- Read our paper ["HTML papers on arXiv -- why it is important, and how we made it happen"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08954).

### arXiv Annual Accessibility Forum
Every year arXiv hosts an accessibility forum in an effort to make accessible research papers a reality. Because if it is not accessible, can we really call it "open" science?

## Further Reading
As arXiv continues on this journey to make our platform and the content we host as accessible as possible, we rely on the enormous contributions and foundational research of the accessibility community, as well as the insights of our users with disabilities who have so generously shared their knowledge and time. Below is further reading from our community, and some internal resources that we hope you find as useful as we have.

- A wonderfully clear [guide to alt-text](https://dis.acm.org/2023/creating-accessible-figures-and-tables/) from Dr. Cynthia Bennett
- Shared by Breanne Kisselstein and Anne Logan, this guide has advice for [creating accessible oral and poster presentations](https://www.ismpmi.org/Community/Interactions/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?List=12f06e9b%2D9922%2D498e%2Da11b%2Da42e98ba0e81&ID=412&Web=ee471bbf%2Dac80%2D48f6%2D883d%2Da3981c7cc59b) for all scientists, including those who are deaf and hard-of-hearing.
- A 2022 paper from Wanda Diaz-Merced and colleagues looks at the [accessibility of Astronomy Journal papers](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kYjCzch1HZKIlD0vmLmI0voTvDa5zokG/view?usp=sharing). Wanda also shared this simple (but not easy) advice for all of us: *"Take concrete actions with no fears."*
- Prepared by Sonja Edler and her colleagues from the Network of Repository Managers at the University of Vienna, these [guidelines on preparing accessible content](https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/detail/o:1594525) address content from images to video and more.
- [Useful terms](accessibility_terms.md) and brief historical context, as applies to arXiv.
