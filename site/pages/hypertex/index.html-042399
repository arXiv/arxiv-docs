<h3>Abstract</h3>
<blockquote>
HyperTeX is a defacto standard for inclusion of hyperlink information in
TeX (and LaTeX) documents. Customized previewers for DVI and Postscript
files exist which enable the user to browse through hyperlinked TeX
files just like one can browse normal HTML files on WWW.

<h3>Introduction</h3></a>
<blockquote>
TeX plays a very important role in scientific and technical 
publishing. Thus far it has however been almost exclusively 
confined to the production of a paper end-product.
<p>
HyperTeX was inspired by the success of the World Wide Web, and is an
extension of TeX structure to embed within a document links to other
parts of the document and to other documents. The information about
these links is stored in the DVI file (or in the postscript or PDF
files that are generated from them), and when viewed with a previewer
that understands this extra information, these links become active and
allow the reader to move with greater ease within and between
documents. External links can be to any document on the internet, in a
manner compatible with the naming scheme used in the WWW.
<p>
For LaTeX documents, there is often a very well defined internal
structure (more sophisticated than the structured markup of HTML which
is the basic language of the WWW), and the HyperTeX definitions allow
a single-line modification of the source LaTeX file (inclusion of a
specific macro package) to turn those internal structures into links
and the document into an active hypertext. There are also several
varieties of plain TeX for which similar modified macro packages are
available. 
<p>
Note that HyperTeX is not intended as a replacement to HTML (just like
PDF, with its capability of storing hyperlink information, is not intended 
to replace HTML). Both have their own strengths. The advantage of 
HyperTeX is that there is no need for a conversion step (which means that
any TeX paper can be extended to include hyperlink information).
<p>
If you're looking for an easy way to get started, the 
<a href="http://www.tug.org/teTeX/">teTeX</a> TeX distribution
might be useful. The most recent version 0.9 contains a HyperTeX 
capable version of xdvi and some
macro packages to help you create your own hyperlinked TeX documents,
as well as a version of dvips that supports creation of pdf files with
hyperlinks. See below for other previewers and other macro packages.

<h3>DVI previewers with HyperTeX support</h3></a>
<blockquote>
Below is a list of DVI previewers for various platforms. Instead of viewing
the DVI file, it is also possible to first convert it to 'hyperhacked' postscript
or PDF and then view it with a modified postscript viewer or a PDF viewer. See
the section on <a href="#pspreview">postscript previewers</a> for details on
that.
<p>
<a name="java"><b>JAVA</b></a> based viewers (for any browser with JAVA support):
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.geom.umn.edu/java/idvi/">IDVI</a>, by Garth A. Dickie
(<a href="mailto:dickie@elastic.avid.com">dickie@elastic.avid.com</a>). Since this
is a JAVA applet, you can use it in any browser with JAVA support (ie. Netscape and
Microsoft Explorer) without installation. 
</ul>

<li>A compiled version of TeXview.app, the nExtstep dvi previewer
augmented for hypertex, was originally provided by
Dmitri Linde (dmitri@physics.stanford.edu [also the author of
InstantTeX.app]). 
<!--This version (dating from the summer of 1994) is <a

<h3>Postscript (and PDF) converters and previewers with support for HyperTeX</h3></a>
<blockquote>
Adobe has implemented a modification of Postscript called Acrobat
(with file extension .pdf = Portable Document Format). It is essentially
a version of uuencoded compressed postscript with a full hyperlink overlay.
In addition, PDF files are <i>searchable and indexable</i>. 
<p>
Using a DVI to postscript converter with HyperTeX support, a postscript file is
generated that includes so called PDF marks. There are postscript viewers which
understand these marks. Alternatively, you can convert the postscript file to
PDF and use a PDF viewer (which naturally have support for hyperlinks).<br>
<p>
<b>DVI to postscript converters with HyperTeX support</b>:
<ul>
<li>The well-known <a href="http://www.radicaleye.com/dvips.html">dvips</a> 
converter by Tom Rokicki supports HyperTeX as of version 5.60a. See <a
href="#postscript2pdf">below</a> for information about how to
convert postscript files to PDF using dvips. The 
<a HREF="http://www.tug.org/teTeX/">teTeX-0.9</a> distribution
has a recent version of dvips, but if your system is still using the
older version 0.4 you might be interested in
<p>
<li>a drop in replacement for dvipsk (5.58f). Download 
<a HREF="http://xxx.lanl.gov/hypertex/sources/dvihpsk.tar.gz">teTeX-dvipsk</a>
and compile it within the teTeX source tree in place of dvipsk
(upgrading the entire teTeX is probably a lot easier).
<p>
<li>There's also still a hyperhacked version of dvips,
<a href="http://t8web.lanl.gov/people/doyle/README_HPS.txt">dvihps</a> written by
Mark Doyle and Tanmoy Bhattacharya. It produces postscript with
embedded links which can subsequently be browsed in a modified version
of ghostview. As this program has not been updated since 1996, the
recommended method is to use dvips and a pdf viewer.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Modifed postscript viewers with HyperTeX support</b>:
<ul>
<li><a HREF="sources/hyper-gs/hyper-ghostview/gv1.5gs5.50hack.tar.gz">HyperHacked Ghostview</a>,
by Tanmoy Bhattacharya 
(<a href="mailto:tanmoy@lanl.gov">tanmoy@lanl.gov</a>).
This is a modified version of Ghostview that understands the links produced by 
<a href="#dvihps">dvihps</a>. You also need either
<a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/gnu/index.html">GNU Ghostscript 3.33</a> or
a recent version of
<a HREF="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/index.html">Aladdin Ghostscript</a>,
e.g. gs 5.03, 5.10, and 5.50, for which we supply
<a HREF="http://xxx.lanl.gov/hypertex/sources/hyper-gs">simple modifications</a>
to make them pass on the hyperlink information to Tanmoy's hyperhacked ghostview.
<p>
</ul>
<p>
<a name="postscript2pdf">
<b>Postscript-with-hyperlinks to PDF converters</b>:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/index.html">Ghostscript</a>
has a program called 'ps2pdf' which converts a postscript file
generated by dvi to a pdf file. 
<p>
You have to use the '-z' flag of dvips to make it include hyperlink
information in the ps file. Not all versions of dvips have this
option (it can be set during compile time by defining '-DHPS' and not 
all installations do this).
<p>
<li><a href="http://www.adobe.com">Adobe Distiller</a> (commercial software)
by Adobe Inc. It converts the output of <a href="#dvihps">dvihps</a> to PDF,
which can then be viewed with a PDF viewer.
</ul>
<p>
<b>PDF viewers</b>:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.adobe.com">Adobe Acrobat</a> (available for free)
by Adobe Inc. This is a viewer for PDF files. It's also available in the form of
a plugin for Netscape and Microsoft Explorer.
<p>
<li><a href="http://www.aimnet.com/~derekn/xpdf/">Xpdf</a>. This
is freely distributable (see the README for details) PDF viewer for Unix/X windows.
<p>
<li><a name="gs" href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/">Ghostscript 3.33</a> and up. These versions have some support for viewing of PDF files.
</ul>
<p>
Han The Thanh (<a href="mailto:thanh@fi.muni.cz">thanh@fi.muni.cz</a>) has written
a modified version of TeX, called pdftex, which outputs PDF directly (instead
of DVI). The LaTeX <a href="#hyperref">hyperref</a> package supports pdftex.
The most recent version of pdftex can be found at <a href="ftp://ftp.cstug.cz/pub/tex/local/cstug/thanh/pdftex">ftp.cstug.cz/pub/tex/local/cstug/thanh/pdftex</a> or
at your local CTAN mirror in 'systems/pdftex'.

<h3>What macro packages support creation of HyperTeX documents?</h3></a>
<blockquote>
If you want to create TeX files yourself that make use of the hyperlink 
facilities of the HyperTeX standard, there are various macro packages
that can help you.
<ul>
<li><a name="hyperref"><a href="ftp://ftp.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/macros/latex2e/contrib/supported/hyperref/">Hyperref</a></a>, 
by Sebastian Rahtz (<a href="mailto:s.rahtz@elsevier.co.uk">s.rahtz@elsevier.co.uk</a>), is
a LaTeX2e package. It provides macros for constructing hyperlinks by hand, and
it can also automatically construct hyperlinks for all the '<tt>\cite</tt>' and
'<tt>\ref</tt>' commands. There is even a script to produce a LaTeX .fmt file which
enables this feature also for documents that do not explicitly activate this package.
Hyperref is included in the latest teTeX distribution. A <a
href="http://www.kumagaya.or.jp/~kazuhito/pc/hypertex.html">Japanese
version</a> of the installation instructions was written by Kazuhito Oyha.
<p>
Also available at any CTAN mirror in the directory 'macros/latex2e/contrib/supported/hyperref/'.
<p>
<li>Michael Mehlich has written a similar package, <a href="ftp://ftp.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/macros/latex2e/contrib/supported/hyper">hyper</a>.
<p>
Also available at any CTAN mirror in the directory 'macros/latex2e/contrib/supported/hyper/'.
<p>
<li><a href="ftp://ftp.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/support/hypertex/tanmoy/hyperbasics.tex">hyperbasics.tex</a> by Tanmoy Bhattacharya. A simple example of
how to write a macropackage supporting HyperTeX.
<p>
<li><a href="sources/macros/hyperlatex.tex">hyperlatex.tex</a>:
(Somewhat outdated and for LaTeX 2.09 only)
For latex-based source, 
automatically upgrades latex macros to hyperlatex (install in tex/inputs
directory).
This file is input before the \documentstyle
when using LaTeX, and  will automatically cause the relevant .hty files 
(if present) to be included after the associated .sty file.
Some .hty files to install in tex/inputs (each containing modifications
to the corresponding .sty file) are available <a href="sources/macros">here</a>
(look for files with extension hty).
<ul>
To define a convenient hlatex format using a format (.fmt) file, use
<a href="sources/macros/hlatex.tex">hlatex.tex</a>
to generate hlatex.fmt
(e.g. on unix systems, use: <code>initex \&latex hlatex.tex</code>)
and install in tex/formats directory.
This format will automatically \input hyperlatex at the
beginning of all documents. Command line use of hlatex.fmt 
is system dependent: on unix systems, 
create a link (e.g. <code>ln -s latex hlatex</code>), then the command
<code>hlatex file</code> replaces <code>latex file</code>
to produce automatic hyperlatex.
</ul>
<p>
<li><a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/hypertex/lanlmac.tex">lanlmac.tex</a>, by <a href="mailto:ginsparg@qfwfq.lanl.gov">Paul Ginsparg</a>.
This is a modified version of harvmac.tex (last updated 7/26/94). It
works seamlessly to convert pre-existing harvmac-based source to hypertex
(see examples <a href="#harvsamp">below</a>).
<p>
<li>Some tools to give the WEB system (tangle/weave) HyperTeX capabilities have
been written by Tanmoy Bhattacharya. In particular,
<a href="sources/macros/hyperwebmac.tex">hyperwebmac.tex</a> 
(modified version of webmac.tex that is used to process .tex generated from
.web by weave),
<a href="sources/macros/hypercwebmac.tex">hypercwebmac.tex</a> 
(modified version of cwebmac.tex [version 2.1] that is used to process .tex
generated from .w by cweave), and
<a href="sources/macros/hyperncwebmac.tex">hyperncwebmac.tex</a> 
(same as above for cwebmac.tex version 3.0) and
<a href="sources/macros/LaTeX2e.conf">LaTeX2e.conf</a>
is (untested) contributed software for latex2e users.
</ul>
<p>
If you use BibTeX, there are various styles that have support for entries
referring to electronic preprints. See <a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/hypertex/bibstyles/">BibTeX and Eprints</a> for a list.

<h3>Demonstration DVI files</h3></a>
<blockquote>
Probably the most extensive source of documents created with HyperTeX aware
macro packages is the electronic preprint archive (for physics and
mathematics) at <a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov">xxx.lanl.gov</a>. Some examples
are available below.
<ul>
<li><a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/hypertex/hharvsamp.dvi" name="harvsamp">harvsamp.dvi</a> : 
A sample file illustrating the modified harvmac macros,
with source <a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/hypertex/hharvsamp.tex">harvsamp.tex</a>.
<li>
<a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/hypertex/hyperlh88.tar.gz">hyperlh88.tar.gz</a>: by popular demand,
dvi file plus figures of Paul Ginsparg's 1988 Les Houches lectures
"Applied Conformal Field Theory" (266kb .gz file gunzips to 911kb).
Good example of pre-existing source that painlessly retexs with new macros
(harvmac/lanlmac) into much more functional form with large numbers of
internal links to sections, subsections, eqns, refs, figs, etc.
<li>
<a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/hypertex/hypertasi92.tar.gz">hypertasi92.tar.gz</a>: dvi file plus figures
from hep-th/9304011 [<a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-th/9304011">abs</a>], 200 page
set of lecture notes using harvmac/lanlmac. (note that 392kb .gz
file gunzips to 1.6Mb -- but worthwhile as another impressive example of
pre-existing source that automatically recompiles with <i>thousands</i> of
internal linkages [couldn't be faked...].)
<li>
<a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/hypertex/emdual.tar.gz">emdual.tar.gz</a> dvi plus two figures from
hep-th/9407087 [<a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-th/9407087">abs</a>], a random
paper that also uses harvmac.
<li>
<a href="http://t8web.lanl.gov/people/tanmoy/programs/hypertex/examples/ambjorn.dvi">ambjorn.dvi</a>:
The dvi file from hep-lat/9405022 [<a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-lat/9405022">abs</a>],
an example file from the e-print archives using latex (article style).
<li><a href="http://t8web.lanl.gov/people/tanmoy/programs/hypertex/examples/Anomalkap.dvi">anomalkap.dvi</a>: The dvi file from hep-lat/9309014
[<a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-lat/9309014">abs</a>], an example file from
the e-print archives using revtex.

The new <a href="http://jhep.cern.ch/">Journal for High Energy Physics</a> also
has all papers online in HyperTeX format.

<a name="implementation">
<h3>How is HyperTeX implemented?</h3></a>
<blockquote>
 TeX and LaTeX output is in the form of a ".dvi" file, the letters being
   short for "device-independent". ".dvi" files are not completely
   self-contained because they depend on external font files, but aside
   from that they describe the formatting of a document in a fashion
   independent of the display or printing device.  The ".dvi" format is
   also arbitrarily extendible, due to the "\special" command of TeX,
   which allows new display commands to be embedded in the ".dvi" file.
   The "\special" command has previously been used to extend TeX by
   allowing inclusion of line drawings, PostScript figures, and colored text.
   
   HyperTeX adds five new "\special" commands to the menagerie. These are:
<pre>
       \special{html:&lt;a href = "hrefstring"&gt;}
       \special{html:&lt;a name = "namestring"&gt;}
       \special{html:&lt;/a&gt;}
       \special{html:&lt;img src = "hrefstring"&gt;}
       \special{html:&lt;base href = "hrefstring"&gt;}
</pre>

   These are identified as HyperTeX specials by the first 4 characters,
   "html". The first three commands establish links between sections of
   documents in a manner exactly analogous to the HTML of the WWW. The "img"
   command is intended to place an image of arbitrary
   graphical format on the page, although currently it is implemented
   as bringing up automatically an external viewer of the appropriate type.
   The "hrefstring" values are arbitrary relative URL's, except for the "base"
   command.  The latter gives the full URL of the current document, which is
   necessary because WWW browsers do not communicate this information to
   external viewers (such as a hyper-dvi browser).

   Rather than just applying these "\special" commands directly, use
   of one of the macro packages (see section 2.) at least as a first step to
   "hyper-izing" a document is recommended.
</blockquote>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<a name="labels">
<h3>What is the standard way to label 'x'?</h3></a>
<blockquote>
The various subsections of a document can be referenced as part of a
URL description through the "#" extension to the URL name. We have
been using the following standard names for ease of linking into
HyperTeX documents based on the macro packages currently available:
<blockquote>
<pre>
Page 5 is at        doc.dvi#page.5
Section 2 is at     doc.dvi#section.2
Equation 3 is at    doc.dvi#equation.3
Reference 11 is at  doc.dvi#reference.11
</pre>
</blockquote>
Similar definitions thus far exist for subsection, figure and table
entities. New macro packages or style files should try to conform to
this naming scheme (see the currently available packages for details
on how this is done).
