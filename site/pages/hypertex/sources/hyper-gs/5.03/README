The two files in this directory are modified versions of the original
distribution of Aladdin ghostscript 5.03 (see
http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/index.html) to enable hyperlinks in Tanmoy's
hyperhacked ghostview 1.5

To install, just replace gs_pdf.ps and gs_pdfwr.ps in your ghostscript
installation directory, typically /usr/local/share/ghostscript/5.03/ , with
the two modified files.
