<span class="note">Update 8/9/01:</span> revtex4 is now fully supported
by arXiv and all its mirrors. Please report problems you may find with
it, see [contact](http://arxiv.org/help/contact), in particular if you
spot problems with older papers (papernum \< 0108001) that may be using
one of the beta versions so that we can fix them.

**Do not use beta versions of revtex4.** Upgrade to the stable release
available at <http://publish.aps.org/revtex4/>.

## Older versions of REVTeX

We strongly recommend that you use the current version of revtex. If you
have an article that uses an older version then you likely need to
package all necessary revtex class/style files with your submission.

## Don't forget to check the processed PDF and/or PostScript\!

As always, carefully check the diagnostic messages sent back to you upon
submission and <span class="note">verify the PDF and/or PostScript
generated by arXiv before the paper is announced</span>.
