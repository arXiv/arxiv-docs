To find an article
==================

Simple search
-------------

Enter a few title words and/or author names and/or abstract words into
the "**Search or Article-id**" box in the top right of most pages
(including this one). The pull-down menu that defaults to "All papers"
may be changed to restrict the search to titles, authors, abstracts, or
extend to the full-text.

If you know the identifier (or archive and paper number)
--------------------------------------------------------

All arXiv submissions are assigned a unique identifier of the form
`yymm.nnnn` (or `arch-ive/yymmnnn` for older submissions). To retrieve
the abstract page a paper simply enter the identifier in the "**Search
or Article-id**" box in the top right of most pages.

You can also construct the URL (web address) for a paper with a given
identifier as `http://arxiv.org/abs/<identifier>`. For example,

>     http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9603067
>     http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.0123

From the abstract page you will be able to choose your preferred format
for [downloading and viewing](view.md) the paper.

Advanced search
---------------

Using the web interface, you can search for articles based on archive
subject area, title, author, keywords in the full abstracts, etc. You
are encouraged to [try it out](/find).

#### Historical note

The email interface to retrieve and search for papers was disabled on 1
April 2007.
