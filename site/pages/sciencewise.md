ScienceWISE
===========

arXiv has partnered with [ScienceWISE](http://sciencewise.info) as part
of a pilot program to provide additional services to arXiv users. These
services include user annotation of papers which are then linked from
arXiv, and [social bookmarking](/help/social_bookmarking).

If you are the owner of one or more papers, you have the option of
annotating your articles with ScienceWISE from your main [account
page](/user), by clicking on the respective icon:
<img src="https://arxiv.org/icons/sciencewise45x32.png" alt="ScienceWISE icon" width="32" height="23" />

You can bookmark interesting abstracts on ScienceWISE via the icon in
the bookmark section that is present on all abstract pages. Please note
that you must first [register](http://sciencewise.info/users/register)
with ScienceWISE to use this feature.

Additional information on the ScienceWISE project is available on their
[FAQ page](http://sciencewise.info/faq).
