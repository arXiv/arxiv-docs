Social Bookmarking
==================

[Social Bookmarking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_bookmarking)
services allow user to save link to web resources they want to remember
or share. The link information is usually public and used in ranking and
searching. Most sites offer additional facilities for tagging,
commentary, and varying degrees of private data collection.

We have selected a few commonly used sites to display on arXiv abstract
pages. There are a collection of social bookmarking service icons in the
right-hand box labeled **Bookmark**. The site name is shown if you
mouse-over an icon. [BibSonomy](http://www.bibsonomy.org/) and
[citeulike](http://www.citeulike.org/) are designed specifically for
scholarly bookmarking.

Social bookmarking services can be used without links on arXiv pages or
other web sites of interest. There are browser plugins for many social
bookmarking services that will work on any web page. Check with the
documentation for the service that interests you.
