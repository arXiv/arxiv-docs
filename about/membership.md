## Membership Tiers

Annual membership tiers are based on submissions by institution. Fees are calculated on 3-year average submission ranks, according to the tiers shown below. In addition to our three main tiers of gold, silver, and bronze, we offer two additional tiers. [Find your institution's submission rank here](reports/2020_institution_submissions).

| Community\*\* | | $1,000 or less |

\*Champion: For institutions that want to lead the way toward open and sustainable research-sharing

The fees listed above for each membership tier are guaranteed for the 2022, 2023, and 2024.
