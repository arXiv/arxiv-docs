As the world's premier open access research sharing platform, arXiv was founded strictly for research and education, not profit. That's why we rely on members --universities, libraries, and other research institutes-- to support our mission with funding and expertise. [Thank you, members](ourmembers)!

<a href="membership_confirm" class="button-fancy">Join or renew today <span> </span></a>

Membership offers your institution a high value, low-risk, budget-conscious option to serve your scholarly community. Members receive public recognition, institutional usage statistics, eligibility to serve in arXiv's governance, [and more](#memberbenefits). The membership program is inclusive and flexible, and it complements arXiv's other [funding sources](funding), including affiliates and sponsors.

## How the standard membership program works

Is arXiv an essential resource for your researchers? If yes, then we invite you to become a member according to the structure described here.  Annual fees are based on submissions by institution, averaged over three years.

First, [find your institution's overall submission rank](reports/2020_institution_submissions). 

Then, match your rank to the fee using this table:

|Rank   |Annual Membership Fees (USD)
|-----------------------------|:--------------------|
| 1-100 | $5,000 |
| 101-500 | $2,500 |
| 501+ | $1,000 |

These fees are guaranteed until 2024. Institutions joining as part of a consortium receive a 10% discount, and country-level consortia receive a larger discount.

## Two alternative programs: Champion and Community Memberships


#

> 1. **Community**
> Is your institution using arXiv primarily for [dowloading and reading papers](reports/2020_institution_downloads_by_year)? Or, is your institution significantly resource-limited? If yes, then community membership is the right choice. Join the arXiv community by choosing your contribution level at $1000 or less.
> 1. **Champion**
> Is your institution a champion of open access and a thought leader in scholarly communications? By contributing $10,000 or more, your institution makes a strong statement in favor of fair and sustainable academic publishing.
