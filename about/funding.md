arXiv’s mission is to provide an open research sharing platform where scholars can share and discover new, relevant, and emerging science, and establish their contribution to advancing research. We are grateful to the community of members, supporters, volunteers, and collaborators who believe in our mission and make this work possible.

arXiv’s financial sustainability depends on maintaining funding sources that are diverse, reliable, and community-based, and our <a href="images/arxiv-membership-program@2x.png" target="_blank">Sustainability Model table</a> ensures that funding responsibility is distributed fairly across arXiv’s dedicated global community.

In addition to [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/), [foundations](supporters), and [individual donors](donate), members, affiliates, and sponsors comprise a substantial portion of arXiv’s budget. 

> 1. **Members**
> [Universities, libraries, laboratories, and research institutes](ourmembers) across the globe represent the scholars who use arXiv to read and share research. Members support arXiv with funding and expertise, and are eligible to serve in arXiv's governance.
> 1. **Affiliates**

> 1. **Sponsors**
