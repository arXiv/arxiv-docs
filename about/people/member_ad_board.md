# Member Advisory Board (MAB)

The Member Advisory Board (MAB) represents participating institutions’ interests and advises Cornell University on issues 
related to repository management and development, standards implementation, interoperability, development priorities, 
business planning, and outreach and advocacy. Representation on MAB is reserved for libraries, research institutions, 
laboratories, and foundations that are members of arXiv and that contribute to the financial support of the service.

The MAB has voting members in three categories: contributing organizations (at least 7), high-contributing organizations (up to 5), Simons Foundation (1). Representatives from contributing organizations are elected. High-contributing organizations represent each consortia or national organization member that contributes 5% or more of arXiv’s annual income generated through membership fees. Additionally, there are five non-voting ex-officio members.

The [MAB Bylaws](/about/mab_bylaws) detail the goals, composition, operation, and election of the Board.
