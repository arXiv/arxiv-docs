arXiv's Scientific Advisory Board is composed of scientists and researchers in disciplines covered by arXiv. The Board provides advice and guidance pertaining to the repository's intellectual oversight, with a particular focus on the policies and operation of arXiv's moderation system. The Board is governed by [Bylaws](/about/sab_bylaws) that detail its duties, composition, and operation as well as the election of its members.

## Subject Advisory Committees

The [physics](/new/physics#advisory_committee),
[mathematics](/new/math#advisory_committee), [computer science
(CoRR)](/corr/advisorycommittee), [quantitative
biology](/new/q-bio#advisory_committee), [quantitative
finance](/new/q-fin#advisory_committee),
[statistics](/new/stat#advisory_committee), and [economics](/help/econ) archives each have
advisory committees, which are overseen loosely by the Scientific
Advisory Board. The chairs of the physics, mathematics, computer
science, and quantitative biology advisory committees serve as ex
officio members of the arXiv Scientific Advisory Board.
