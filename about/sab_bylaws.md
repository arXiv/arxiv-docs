# arXiv Scientific Advisory Board Bylaws

_Revisions adopted on 20 August 2019_

*Article 1. Definitions*
1.1	The name of the organization is the arXiv Scientific Advisory Board, hereinafter referred to as SAB and the Board. SAB is a consultative body advising the Cornell University, hereinafter referred to as CU.
1.2	CU holds overall responsibility for arXiv’s operation and development, with strategic and operational guidance from the SAB and the Member Advisory Board, hereinafter referred to as MAB. The arXiv Operating Principles delineate the respective roles of CU, SAB, and MAB.
1.3	The SAB is composed of scientists and researchers in areas covered by arXiv. Among other duties, the SAB provides advice and guidance pertaining to the intellectual oversight of arXiv, with particular focus on the policies and operation of arXiv’s moderation system. The complete role of the SAB is described in the arXiv Operating Principles.

*Article 2. Scientific Advisory Board Membership*
2.1	_Classes of Members_
	The SAB shall have two classes of members: 1) Voting Members, and 2) Non-Voting Members.
2.1.1	_Voting Board Members_
a)	_Number._ There shall be between 10 and 14 Voting Board Members on the SAB. The number of SAB Voting Members may be changed by an amendment to these Bylaws, as described in 7.1. No decrease in the number of Voting Members shall have the effect of shortening the term of any incumbent SAB member.
b)	_Qualifications._ At least two-thirds of Voting Board Members shall be drawn from the arXiv membership of Contributing Organizations (“Contributing Organizations”), as defined in the arXiv Operating Principles.
c)	_Ex officio Subject Advisory Committee Chairs._ The Chairs of the Subject Advisory Committees in Physics, Mathematics, Computer Science shall be ex officio members of the Board. In addition, there will be two ex officio members in representation of the other arXiv sections. Chairs of any other Subject Committee which the Board deems appropriate can also be included. Such ex officio members shall have all the rights and duties of other Voting Board Members.
d)	_Reserved Funder Board Seats._ Foundations and other funders identified by CU as contributing 25% or more of arXiv’s annual operating funding shall have the right to a seat on the SAB. These seats must be filled by scientists, and nominees for the seat must be approved by a majority vote of Voting Board Members then in office. Board members holding reserved Board seats shall have all the rights and duties of other Voting Board Members.
e)	_Election._ All Voting SAB Members, except for ex officio Subject Advisory Committee Chairs (c) and any member filling a Reserved Funder Board seat (d), shall be elected at the Scientific Advisory Board’s Annual Meeting by a majority vote of the Voting Board Members then in office excluding any conflicted Members. Members shall be elected from the candidates proposed to the Board by the Nominating Committee or made known to Board members by other means. Any Member whose term is ending shall be considered as conflicted for the discussion and vote unless this Member explicitly declares that he/she is not available for an additional term.
f)	_Term of Office._ All Voting Members of the SAB shall serve staggered, three-year renewable terms.
2.1.2	_Non-Voting Members_
a)	Reserved CU Seats. Up to five SAB seats are reserved for CU. These will be filled by the arXiv Scientific Director, arXiv Program Director, and the arXiv IT and User Support managers, or other CU staff as appointed by the University Librarian of CU. The role of these members is to provide information, participate in Board discussions, and document SAB discussions by keeping the minutes of all SAB meetings. 
b)	Reserved MAB Seats. Two SAB seats are reserved for members of the Member Advisory Board, who shall be appointed to the SAB as specified by the MAB Bylaws.

**Article 4. SAB Operation**
4.1	_Decisions of the Board._ All meetings of the SAB shall be conducted in a manner that seeks consensual agreement. When the Board considers any matter that requires a decision, the opinion of any Board member who wishes to express an opinion shall be considered by the Board. When the Chair determines that all Voting Board Members present are generally united in their judgment, he or she shall attempt to state clearly the “sense of the Board.” If all Voting Board Members present give approval to this statement, or if some Voting Board Members present are not in agreement but are willing to stand aside and accept and uphold the judgment of the majority, consensual agreement shall be reached and shall be considered a decision of the Board.
	If consensual agreement cannot be reached, a vote shall be taken by the Voting Board Members present. Both majority and minority opinions shall be recorded and made available to CU and the MAB.

4.3	_SAB and MAB communication._ The Board meeting agendas and minutes will be shared with the MAB for their review and comments. The MAB representatives on the SAB will act as liaisons and may seek input from their colleagues as needed prior to or after the Board deliberations.

*Article 6. Committees*
6.1	_Standing Board Committees._ The SAB may, by a resolution adopted by a decision of the Board, designate and appoint one or more committees, each consisting of two or more Board members, which committees shall have and exercise the authority of the Board.

6.2	_Nominating Committee._ Each year, the Chair or the Chair’s designee shall submit for the approval of the SAB a list of not less than three nor more than five individuals, comprised of SAB members (who shall constitute a majority of the committee) and representatives from Contributing Organizations that do not currently have a representative serving on the Board, to serve on the Nominating Committee.  The Nominating Committee shall propose a slate of candidates for election to the SAB, or as a Chair of a Subject Advisory Committee, in advance of any Annual Meeting of the SAB that includes Board member election. Nominating Committee members shall serve for one-year terms or until their successors have been appointed.
