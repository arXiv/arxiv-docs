Authority Records
=================

Since 2005 arXiv has maintained *authority records* that link a person's
arXiv account with the papers that they have written. We currently
use authority records to support the [endorsement system](endorsement.md),
[ORCID iDs](orcid.md), and our public [arXiv author
identifiers](author_identifiers.md).

arXiv can also record third-party *paper owners*, users with rights to
update or replace a paper but who are not authors. All users recorded as
authors are automatically paper owners too. This status is used to
support third-party submission by approved conference organizers and
journals. Users may log-in to see [a list](http://arxiv.org/user/) of
papers they have written or own.

For submitters
--------------

When you submit a paper, you will automatically be registered as an
*owner* of that paper. At submission time, we will ask if you are an
author, and if you say yes, you will automatically be registered as an
*author*. Your co-authors can become authors by giving them the [paper
password](passwords.md) for the paper. They can then enter the arXiv
identifier and paper password on the [claim
ownership](http://arxiv.org/auth/need-paper-password.php) form. We
recommend that you share the paper password with all of the authors of
each paper you submit and encourage them to register themselves as
owners.

If you have submitted a paper in the past, it is quite likely that you
are already registered as an author. However, because this is an
imprecise process of matching e-mail addresses and names, we have
probably made mistakes in some cases. If papers you have submitted are
missing entirely from your [list](http://arxiv.org/user/) of papers, you
should follow the instructions below for *other authors*. If a paper is
on your list of papers you own, but you are not registered as an author,
you can use the "Change Author Status" link on your [user
information](http://arxiv.org/user/) page.

Other authors
-------------

Since most papers have multiple authors, it is quite likely that you are
the author of a paper that you did not submit personally. In that case,
you should ask the submitter to give you the paper password -- with the
paper password, you can quickly [claim
ownership](http://arxiv.org/auth/need-paper-password.php) of the paper.
You can also [request
ownership](http://arxiv.org/auth/request-ownership.php) of a paper
without your paper password, but this process requires manual
intervention from our operator and may result in a delay of several
days; our administrators may also need to contact you to verify that
your authorship claim is correct.
