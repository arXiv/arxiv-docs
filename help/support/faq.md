arXiv -- GENERAL QUESTIONS
--------------------------

<span id="1A"></span>

### What is arXiv?

arXiv.org is widely acknowledged as one of the most successful open
access digital archives. In August 1991, Paul Ginsparg created arXiv as
a mechanism repository for preprint exchanges in high energy physics; in
2001, it moved to Cornell University Library (CUL) and in January 2019 it moved to Computing and Information Sciences (CIS) at Cornell University. Now, it has
transformed scholarly communication in multiple fields of physics and
plays an increasingly prominent role in mathematics, computer science,
quantitative biology, quantitative finance, and statistics. It is
embedded in the research workflows of these subjects and allows the
rapid dissemination of scientific findings. By providing open access to
researchers worldwide, arXiv makes science more democratic.

Since its inception in 1991 with a focus on the high energy physics
community, arXiv has significantly expanded both its subject coverage
and user base. During 2015, the repository saw 105,000 new submissions
and over 139 million downloads from all over the world. arXiv is
international in scope, with [mirror
sites](/help/mirrors) in five countries and
collaborations with U.S. and foreign research facilities, libraries,
universities and other international organizations.

<span id="1B"></span>

### What are arXiv's key principles?

arXiv provides an open-access repository of scientific research to
authors and researchers worldwide. It is a moderated scholarly
communication forum informed and guided by scientists and the scientific
cultures it serves. Access via arXiv.org is free to all end-users, and
individual researchers can deposit their own content in arXiv for free.
Please see the [arXiv
Principles](https://confluence.cornell.edu/download/attachments/340902451/arXivPrinciplesMarch12.pdf)
document for the operational, editorial, economic, and governance
principles.

<span id="1C"></span>

### Where can I find out more about arXiv submission and moderation?

Material submitted to arXiv is expected to be interesting, relevant, and
valuable to those disciplines. arXiv reserves the right to reject or
reclassify any submission. Expert moderators review submissions to
verify that they are topical and refereeable scientific contributions
that follow accepted standards of scholarly communication (as
exemplified by conventional journal articles). Please see
[http://arxiv.org/help/moderation](/help/moderation) for information
about review policies.

<span id="1D"></span>

### What is arXiv's history and impact?

Please see these three resources for a brief roundup of where arXiv came
from and why it is important:

arXiv user survey results and plans for the future: [arXiv preprint
server plans multimillion-dollar
overhaul](http://www.nature.com/news/arxiv-preprint-server-plans-multimillion-dollar-overhaul-1.20181)

Highlighting the significance of arXiv: [arXiv Hits 1 Million
Submissions.](https://www.library.cornell.edu/about/news/press-releases/arxiv-hits-1-million-submissions-0)

Founder Paul Ginsparg on the early days of arXiv: [It was twenty years
ago today...](https://arxiv.org/abs/1108.2700v2)

<span id="steward"></span>
### Who is arXiv's organizational steward?
In January 2019, the administrative and operational responsibilities for the IT infrastructure and user support collaboration for arXiv moved from Cornell University Library (CUL) to Cornell Computing and Information Science (CIS). Cornell has hosted arXiv since 2001 when its founder, Paul Ginsparg, left the Los Alamos National Laboratory and joined the Cornell faculty in the Physics and Information Science departments. Running the service has always involved a collaboration with CIS as Professor Ginsparg and other CIS faculty lead R&D efforts through several NSF grants and other funding sources, and contribute to the development of moderation policies. This transition is a natural stage in the evolution of arXiv, required for optimum service delivery and infrastructure sustainability. For more information, see: [transition FAQ](https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/arxivpub/Transition+FAQ%3A+Move+to+Cornell+Computing+and+Information+Science).

<span id="1E"></span>

### Will arXiv be expanded to other subjects?

Since its inception in 1991 with a focus on the high energy physics
community, arXiv has significantly expanded both its subject coverage to
include subfields in physics, mathematics, computer science,
quantitative biology, quantitative finance and statistics. We have
adopted a measured approach to continued expansion, because significant
organizational and administrative efforts are required to create and
maintain new subject areas. Adding a new subject area involves exploring
the user base and use characteristics pertaining to the subject area,
establishing the necessary advisory committees, and recruiting
moderators. Although arXiv.org is the central portal for scientific
communication in some disciplines, it is neither feasible nor
necessarily desirable to play that role in all disciplines.

In 2017, arXiv introduced two new fields of coverage: Electrical
Engineering and Systems Science (EESS, <https://arxiv.org/archive/eess>)
and Economics (econ <https://arxiv.org/archive/econ>) our first new
fields since the addition of Qualitative Finance in 2008.

<span id="1I"></span>

### What is arXiv Next Generation (arXiv-NG)?

arXiv-NG is a 3-year project (2016-2019) to modernize the architecture
of arXiv.org and to improve some portions of the user interface
(including the moderation interface and search capabilities). arXiv-NG
is funded both with Grants (so far from the Sloan Foundation, Allen
Institute for Artificial Intelligence and the Heising-Simons Foundation)
and with development reserves from arXiv.org. Since 2018,
arXiv-NG funding and expenses is included on the arXiv.org budget.
For more information on this ongoing project, please see the [arXiv-NG
wiki](https://confluence.cornell.edu/x/QsJRF).

<span id="1F"></span>

### What is the relationship between arXiv and SCOAP3?

arXiv and [SCOAP3 (Sponsoring Consortium for Open Access Publishing in
Particle Physics)](http://scoap3.org/) are complementary in both scope
and function. arXiv is a scholarly communication forum that serves the
needs of researchers for rapid open-access dissemination of pre-prints
in a broad range of fields including physics, mathematics, computer
science, quantitative biology, quantitative finance, and statistics.
SCOAP3 tackles the issue of sustainable open access to peer-reviewed
publications in high-energy physics (HEP), one of the many categories
supported by arXiv (and typically representing less than 20% of
submissions to arXiv). These publications appear up to one year later
than the arXiv preprint, and are important for the community as the
definitive versions of record used by universities and funding agencies
for accountability purposes, while the scholarly discourse proceeds on
arXiv (see <http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.5418>).

Whereas SCOAP3 collaborates with publishers to provide open access to
formally published, refereed HEP content, arXiv is a moderated scholarly
communication forum informed and guided by scientists and the scientific
cultures it serves. Expert moderators review submissions to verify that
they are topical and of interest to the scientific community, follow
accepted standards of scholarly communication, and are classified in the
appropriate subject categories. As such, arXiv classification is a
valuable and crucial element in the identification of articles for which
SCOAP3 financially supports publication. As the SCOAP3 initiative
continues to evolve, arXiv and SCOAP3 are fully committed to further
discussions about shared opportunities in the area of open-access
scientific communication, leveraging the strong co-operative bonds and
shared OA principles of the two teams in other initiatives. At this
point, arXiv financial planning does not assume any direct transfer of
resources from the SCOAP3 project.

<span id="1G"></span>

### What is the relationship between arXiv and the other -rXivs (eg: bioRxiv, SocArXiv, engrXiv)?

There is not currently a formal relationship between arXiv.org and the
other -rXivs. arXiv is a trademark of Cornell University, used under
license by the other -rXivs. This license should not be understood to
indicate endorsement of content on any other -rXiv by Cornell University
or arXiv.

<span id="1H"></span>

### Who are arXiv's members?

arXiv.org is glad to count over 220 institutions from around the world
amongst its members, for a full list please see [arXiv
members](https://confluence.cornell.edu/x/ALlRF). Learn more about [membership](https://arxiv.org/help/membership).

 

BUSINESS MODEL AND BUDGET
-------------------------

<span id="2A"></span>

### What is arXiv's current operating budget?

See our [current and past year
budgets.](https://confluence.cornell.edu/x/BKpRF)

<span id="2B"></span>

### What is the revenue model for arXiv?

arXiv's revenue model is based upon the Economic Principles, outlined in
the [arXiv Operating
Principles](https://confluence.cornell.edu/download/attachments/340902451/arXivPrinciplesMarch12.pdf).
Cornell University Library (CUL), the [Simons
Foundation](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/), and a global collective
of 220+ institutional members from 25 countries support arXiv
financially. The [financial
model](https://confluence.cornell.edu/x/mJx0F) for 2018-22 entails four
sources of revenues:

-   CUL provides a cash subsidy of $170,000 per year in support of
    arXiv's operational costs. In addition, CUL makes an in-kind
    contribution of all indirect costs, which currently represents 37%
    of total operating expenses.
-   The Simons Foundation contributes $100,000 per year in recognition
    of CUL's stewardship of arXiv.
-   The Simons Foundation matches $300,000 per year of the funds
    generated through arXiv membership fees.
-   Each member institution pledges a five-year funding commitment to
    support arXiv. Based on institutional usage ranking, the annual fees
    are set in four tiers from $1,000-$4,400.

In 2016, Cornell raised approximately $530,000 through membership fees
from 200+ institutions and the total revenue (including CUL and Simons
Foundation direct contributions) was around $1,046,000. For full budget
information, please see our [current and past year
budgets.](https://confluence.cornell.edu/x/BKpRF)

Beginning in 2018, arXiv also shows grants and expenses for arXiv-NG
on its budgets. Funding sources for this 3-year project include:

-   The Sloan Foundation contributes $445,000 for partnerships and
    technical development.
-   The Heising-Simons Foundation contributes $322,000 for technical
    development.
-   The Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2) contributes
    $200,000 to support a 12-month pilot implementation of [Semantic
    Scholar](/help/semanticscholar).

<span id="2C"></span>

### What is the purpose of the annual matching fund from the Simons Foundation?

The gift aims to encourage long-term community support by keeping arXiv
membership fees low, making participation affordable to a broader range
of institutions. This support helps ensure that the ultimate
responsibility for sustaining arXiv remains with the research
communities and institutors that benefit from the service most directly.
We are grateful for the ongoing support of Simons Foundation.

<span id="2D"></span>

### Why does the budget include reserves?

The arXiv Reserves support expenses to ensure a sound business model
(Development Reserves) and to support a transition to a new host
institution (Operating Reserves. Please note: this is a cautionary
reserve and there are no plans to transfer arXiv). Currently, arXiv has
approximately $680,000 in Development Reserves and approximately
$250,000 in Operating Reserves accumulated during the last six years due
to unexpected staff vacancies and other savings, such as the transition
to virtual servers. Guidelines for using these funds are contained in
the [arXiv Reserve Policy](https://confluence.cornell.edu/x/BKpRF)

<span id="2E"></span>

### Are there plans to identify additional revenue sources to diversify arXiv's funding?

In the process of investigating business models, arXiv considered many
options and ruled out article-processing charges and submission fees.
Barrier-free submission and use is one of the founding principles of
arXiv. The conclusion of the Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) and the
Member Advisory Board (MAB) 2015 annual meetings was that, in addition
to the current business model with a focus on maintenance, the arXiv
team needs to embark on a significant fundraising effort to improve
technical infrastructure, pursuing both grants and collaborations. These
two recommendations are being actively followed in our arXiv-NG project.
In addition to our institutional membership program, arXiv accepts both
[personal donations](#7C) and [sponsored memberships](#7M)

<span id="2F"></span>

### How did arXiv develop this Business and Governance Model?

Since 2010, arXiv's sustainability planning
initiative has aimed to reduce arXiv's financial burden and dependence
on a single institution, instead creating a broad-based,
community-supported resource. To keep an open access academic resource
like arXiv sustainable, administrators must continue to enhance its
value based on the needs of all its user communities, as well as cover
the associated operating costs. arXiv's initiative strives to
strengthen arXiv's technical, service, financial, and policy
infrastructure.

As an interim strategy, arXiv initially established a voluntary
institutional contribution model, inviting pledges from 200 libraries
and research laboratories worldwide that represent arXiv's heaviest
institutional users. During this 2010-12 planning process, arXiv sought
input from a wide range of stakeholders to position arXiv as a
collaboratively governed, community-supported resource. The planning
effort also included a meeting with representatives of several
publishers and societies to discuss the feasibility and desirability of
collaborating, which would improve crosslinking, interoperability, and
lifecycle support for research material.

The sustainability planning process aimed to investigate how to
diversify revenue models, ensure that arXiv meets a set of governance
principles, and provide transparent and reliable community-supported
service. arXiv's membership model is the key outcome of the three-year
planning process, which was facilitated by a planning grant from the
[Simons Foundation.](https://simonsfoundation.org/)

 

arXiv MEMBERSHIP MODEL
----------------------

<span id="3A"></span>

### What are the goals of the arXiv Institutional Membership Program?

To help with arxiv's support and governance, the membership program aims
to engage libraries and research laboratories worldwide that represent
arXiv's heaviest institutional users. Each member institution pledges a
five-year initial funding commitment to support arXiv. arXiv's financial
plan is founded on [arXiv's operating
principles](https://confluence.cornell.edu/download/attachments/340902451/arXivPrinciplesMarch12.pdf)
and presents a [business model](https://confluence.cornell.edu/x/mJx0F)
for generating revenues.

<span id="3B"></span>

### Who can be a member?

Membership in arXiv and representation on the Member Advisory Board
(MAB) is reserved for libraries, research institutions, laboratories,
professional organizations, foundations and other non-profit entities
that contribute to the financial support of the service. Although they
cannot be voting members, we do welcome financial support from
[individuals](#7C), publishers, and other interested parties. We request
membership from institutions responsible for the top 75% of downloads,
from 2009-2015 this was the top 200 institutional users, since 2016 it
is the top 250.

<span id="3F"></span>

### How much are the institutional membership fees?

Membership fees are based on a 3-year rolling average of institutional
ranking calculated according to the number of articles downloaded. Usage
statistics and institutional rankings are calculated annually (usually
in January). The usage statistics for the top 200+ institutional users
since 2009 are available online at [arXiv
Support.](https://confluence.cornell.edu/x/k7BRF)

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">

<span id="3D"></span>

### What are the benefits of becoming a member?

Aside from the knowledge that you are part of a shared investment in a
culturally embedded resource that provides unambiguous value to a global
network of scientific researchers, exclusive benefits for member
organizations include:

-   Participation in arXiv's ongoing governance through the Member
    Advisory Board, which provides input for project prioritization, new
    service offerings, financial planning, use of discretionary funds,
    future technical developments, and policy decisions;
-   Access to enhanced institutional use statistics;
-   Public acknowledgement of members' role in financial support listed
    on arXiv.org and locally to the institution via an IP generated
    banner.

<span id="3E"></span>

### How are the member institutions acknowledged?

arXiv members are [acknowledged online](https://confluence.cornell.edu/x/m4NRF).
Additionally, through IP identification, the users of these institutions see an
acknowledgement banner to indicate support from their home institutions.
It is critical to raise awareness about the resource needs for running
scientific repositories and the roles of member libraries in securing
arXiv's future.

<span id="3C"></span>

### How can I find information about my institution's usage statistics for arXiv?

The usage statistics for the top 200+ institutional users
since 2009 are available online at [arXiv
Support.](https://confluence.cornell.edu/x/k7BRF). If your institution
is not listed, please contact us at membership@arxiv.org for usage
statistics. If you are an arXiv member, your institutional statistics
will be sent to you annually with your invoice.

<span id="3G"></span>

### How can I find information about my institution's submissions to arXiv?

Unfortunately, it is very difficult for arXiv to track submissions from
a particular institution to arXiv. The author metadata arXiv collects is
not sufficiently consistent to support systematic submission analysis.

Manual analysis of a single month of submissions in 2013 indicated a
similar ranking in submission- and download-based data. We continue to
refine our findings and appreciate ideas about how this information can
be used for business-planning purposes. In time, arXiv expects to
undertake metadata remediation to improve the authorship data for
existing submissions. This will enable better author linking, allow
improvements in ownership claiming, and pave the way to support author
identity linking using [ORCID](http://www.orcid.org) author identifiers.

<span id="3H"></span>

### Do supporting institutions sign an agreement for five-year pledges of support?

No, member institutions only commit on an annual basis. The initial five-year commitment in 2013
was a good-faith intention to support arXiv for the next five years. It
was not a lump-sum payment or a legally binding contract.

<span id="3I"></span>

### What is the timeline for invoicing?

arXiv runs on a Calendar Year billing cycle (Jan-Dec), and generally
invoices in February or March. Timelines are flexible, and we are
willing to delay billing until fall at an institution’s request. Please
contact us at membership@arxiv.org to request alternative invoice date.

<span id="3J"></span>

### How are the usage tiers calculated and why focus on the top 250 institutional users?

Use is measured by article downloads. arXiv focuses on the top 250
institutions because they account for about 75% of institutionally
identifiable downloads (top 200 institutions prior to 2016). This is not
a mandatory fee-based funding model that would force anyone to support
arXiv to secure access to the content; access to arXiv both for
submitters and users will remain free. arXiv is also happy to accept and
acknowledge support from other libraries and research laboratories.

<span id="3K"></span>

### Our institution is not listed in the Top 250, but we would like to become a supporting member. What is the process?

Please email us at membership@arxiv.org. We are always happy to have new
members!

<span id="3L"></span>

### Is the tier model fair? What about free-riders?

arXiv is a primary destination site for authors and readers in its core
domains within physics, computer science and math. Supporting arXiv is a
shared community investment in a culturally embedded resource that
provides unambiguous value to a global network of science researchers.
Any system of voluntary contribution is susceptible to free-riders, but
arXiv is extremely cost-effective, so even modest contributions from
heavy-user institutions will support continued open access for all. The
arXiv Membership Model realizes good value for use for participating
organizations compared with many subscription services, and offers
exclusive benefits in recognition of their contributions to arXiv.

<span id="3M"></span>

### Why does arXiv ask for institutional IP addresses from supporting institutions?

Members are openly acknowledged on the arXiv.org website, and for
institutions that provide IP address information, CUL can customize the
message in the upper right of the arXiv banner to read, "We gratefully
acknowledge support from \[member institution\]."

<span id="3N"></span>

### How can I stay informed about arXiv sustainability and membership initiatives?

Please join the arXiv support announcement email list by sending an
email message to arxiv-support-updates-L-request@cornell.edu. Leave the
subject line blank. The body of the message should be a single word:

arXiv GOVERNANCE
----------------

<span id="4A"></span>

### How does the arXiv Governance Model work?

Computing and Information Science (CIS) at Cornell University holds the overall administrative and
financial responsibility for arXiv's operation and development, with
guidance from its Member Advisory Board (MAB) and its Scientific
Advisory Board (SAB). CUL manages the moderation of submissions and user
support, including the development and implementation of policies and
procedures; operates arXiv's technical infrastructure; assumes
responsibility for archiving to ensure long-term access; oversees arXiv
mirror sites; and establishes and maintains collaborations with related
initiatives to improve services for the scientific community through
interoperability and tool-sharing.

<span id="4B"></span>

### What is the role of the arXiv Scientific Advisory Board?

The SAB is composed of scientists and researchers in disciplines covered
by arXiv. It provides advice and guidance pertaining to the repository's
intellectual oversight, with a particular focus on the policies and
operation of arXiv's moderation system. SAB reviews and revises the
criteria and standards for deposit in arXiv; proposes new subject or
discipline domains to be covered by arXiv; provides scientists' feedback
on arXiv development projects proposed by the MAB. The SAB also makes
recommendations regarding development projects, in particular,
suggestions for improving the systems that support submission and
moderation processing.

<span id="4C"></span>

### What is the role of the arXiv Member Advisory Board?

The MAB is made up of elected representatives from arXiv's membership
and serves as a consultative body. The board represents participating
institutions' interests and advises arXiv on issues related to repository
management and development, standards implementation, interoperability,
development priorities, business planning, financial planning, and
outreach and advocacy. Membership in arXiv and representation on the MAB
is reserved for libraries, research institutions, laboratories, and
foundations that contribute to the financial support of the service.
Voting for representatives to the MAB is open to all eligible member
institutions, which each hold one vote. The [MAB
bylaws](https://confluence.cornell.edu/x/NKlRF) specify the board's
operations, including composition, member appointment methods, and term
of office.

<span id="4D"></span>

### What is the process for member organizations to nominate candidates for the Member Advisory Board?

Elections to the Member Advisory Board (MAB) are coordinated by the MAB
Elections committee. Board members can be proposed by the Elections
Committee or nominated by any member institution. All nominations must
have the approval of the nominee and be submitted in writing at least 30
days prior to the annual Meeting of the Board. For more information on
roles and responsibilities of MAB members, please see the [MAB
bylaws](https://confluence.cornell.edu/x/NKlRF).

<span id="4F"></span>

### Who is on arXiv's Advisory Boards?

The current roster of the [Member Advisory
Board](https://confluence.cornell.edu/x/NqlRF) and [Scientific Advisory
Board](/help/scientific_ad_board) are on their
respective websites.

 

STAFFING AND EXPENSES
---------------------

<span id="5A"></span>

### What are arXiv's operating costs?

arXiv's operating costs for 2018-22 are projected to average of
$1,465,000 per year, including indirect expenses and arXiv-NG. The
[operating budget projections for
2017-2022](https://confluence.cornell.edu/x/mJx0F) include the four key
sources of revenues mentioned above: Cornell's annual funding of
$170,000 per year, plus indirect expenses; the $100,000 per year gift
from the [Simons Foundation](https://simonsfoundation.org/); annual fee
income from the member institutions; and the $300,000 per year challenge
grant from the Simons Foundation, based on the revenues generated
through membership payments.

<span id="5B"></span>

### How is arXiv staffed?

As of January 2018, arXiv has 11.35 FTE (full time equivalent) staff
members. arXiv’s budget directly funds 10.9 FTE, the remaining .45 FTE
is provided as “in kind” support by Cornell University Library (this
includes Financial Support, Technology Strategy Advisor, and Membership
Coordinator). arXiv has 6 people working on IT and related issues (total
5.5 FTE), 6 staff + varying students working on Operations and
Administration (total 4.9 FTE), and a Scientific Director (.5 FTE). For
a graphic representation of this information, please see the arXiv
[Organizational Structure](https://confluence.cornell.edu/x/m4NRF)
chart. arXiv also relies on hundreds of volunteer moderators around the
world, whose diligence is greatly appreciated.

 

arXiv @ CIS
-----------

<span id="6A"></span>

### What is the relationship between arXiv.org and Computing and Information Sciences (CIS)?

Computing and Information Sciences (CIS) at Cornell University holds the overall administrative and financial
responsibility for arXiv's operation and development, with guidance from
its Member Advisory Board (MAB) and its Scientific Advisory Board (SAB).
CIS manages the moderation of submissions and user support, including
the development and implementation of policies and procedures; operates
arXiv's technical infrastructure; assumes responsibility for archiving
to ensure long-term access; oversees arXiv mirror sites; and establishes
and maintains collaborations with related initiatives to improve
services for the scientific community through interoperability and
tool-sharing.
From 2001 until January 2019, Cornell University Library (CUL) was the steward of arXiv.org.

<span id="6B"></span>

### What are arXiv's preservation strategies?

For arXiv, digital preservation refers to a range of managed activities
to support the long-term maintenance of bitstreams. These activities
ensure that digital objects are usable (intact and readable), retaining
all quantities of authenticity, accuracy, and functionality deemed to be
essential when articles (and other associated materials) were ingested.
Formats accepted by arXiv have been selected based on their archival
value (TeX/LaTeX, PDF, HTML) and the ability to process all source files
is actively monitored. The underlying bits are protected by standard
backup procedures at the Cornell campus. Off-site backup facilities in
New York City provide geographic redundancy. The complete content is
replicated at arXiv's mirror sites around the world, and additional
managed tape backups are taken at Los Alamos National Laboratory. CIS
has a distinct archival repository to support preservation of critical
content from its institutional resources, including arXiv. We anticipate
storing all arXiv documents, both in source and processed form, with
incremental ingest of new material. We expect that CIS will bear the
preservation costs for arXiv.

### Is there an automated way to download the arXiv papers of the authors from my institution to our IR?

Please see details of [Institutional Repository (IR)
Interoperability](/help/ir).

<span id="6D"></span>

### Does arXiv accept research data?

arXiv ran a pilot from 2011-2013 with the [Data
Conservancy](http://dataconservancy.org/) to support remote data deposit
for arXiv submissions. This pilot was initially funded by the [US
National Science Foundation](https://nsf.gov/). The pilot data
repository was discontinued in 2015, and datasets were merged into arXiv
as ancillary files (see
[http://arxiv.org/help/data_conservancy](/help/data_conservancy) for
more information).

Ancillary files are still accepted. These may include raw data for
tables or plots, program code, workbooks or spreadsheets. More information can be found here:
[http://arxiv.org/help/ancillary\_files](/help/ancillary_files).

 

NON-MEMBER SUPPORTERS: PERSONAL DONATIONS, SPONSORSHIP, AND ONLINE GIVING
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span id="7A"></span>

### Is my institution currently supporting arXiv?

See our [members](https://confluence.cornell.edu/x/ALlRF).

<span id="7B"></span>

### Can non-academic institutions support arXiv?

Yes, non-academic institutions (eg: publishers, private businesses) can
support arXiv through direct annual donations, and through mechanisms
like Employee Donation Match. It is important to arXiv.org that we
remain an open access resource that is governed by scholars, through
both our Scientific and our Member Advisory Boards. For this reason, we
do not allow corporate supporters to be voting members.

<span id="7C"></span>

### PERSONAL DONATIONS / How can I donate to arXiv?

You may [donate to
arXiv](/about/donate)
through the Cornell University Alumni & Friends website. 100% of your
contribution will fund improvements and new initiatives that will
benefit arXiv's global scientific community.

<span id="7D"></span>

### PERSONAL DONATIONS / Is my gift tax deductible?

Yes!

<span id="7E"></span>

### What is Cornell's tax ID number?

<span id="7F"></span>

### PERSONAL DONATIONS / Can I contribute from outside the U.S.?

Yes, Cornell accepts international credit cards, and arXiv welcomes
support from around the world! [Donate to
arXiv](/about/donate)

<span id="7G"></span>

### PERSONAL DONATIONS / What initiatives will my contribution help support?

In addition to helping arXiv robustly fulfill its open access
[mission](/help/primer), contributions help fund
special projects; see the Special Projects section in the [arXiv
roadmap](https://confluence.cornell.edu/x/GaZRF). As we described in our
last [annual update](https://confluence.cornell.edu/x/LMlRF), the
current business model is working well to cover arXiv's baseline
maintenance costs with support from 210+ member organizations, the
Simons Foundation, and Cornell University Library. However, we need to
raise additional resources in order to fund new initiatives and
functionality requirements that are beyond the routine operational work.

<span id="7H"></span>

### PERSONAL DONATIONS / My institution currently supports arXiv. Why should I?

Our member organizations give generously to support our current
operating budget. arXiv's business plan expects baseline
maintenance, with additional funding from grants and reserves
for arXiv-NG redevelopment. We are actively fundraising for this
project, and welcome support from those who are able to give. Your gift
will help fund innovation and enhancements so arXiv can remain a vital,
global open access resource. [Donate to
arXiv](/about/donate)

<span id="7I"></span>

### ONLINE GIVING / Why does a payment page from Cornell University appear?

arXiv is managed by Cornell University. The workflow for
processing our online donations is managed by Cornell Alumni Affairs and
Development. Your gift will support arXiv and only arXiv. [Donate to
arXiv](/about/donate)

<span id="7J"></span>

### ONLINE GIVING / What is arXiv going to do with my personal information?

Your address and phone number will be used to verify your credit
card information. Donors to arXiv may receive future fundraising emails from arXiv and Cornell University and contain options to unsubscribe. Your information is never shared with any third party marketing services.

<span id="7K"></span>

### ONLINE GIVING / Why am I being asked for "In Honor/Memory" information?

The online donation portal is managed by Cornell Alumni Affairs and
Development and includes several fields not required to donate to
arXiv.org, such as "In Honor/Memory" designations. Please feel free to
donate "In Honor/Memory" if you would like, or to skip this designation
by pressing the "Continue" button (on the Lower Right).

<span id="7L"></span>

### ONLINE GIVING / Do I get a receipt?

Yes. After you give you will be issued a thank you page. The thank you
page serves as a receipt.

<span id="7M"></span>

### SPONSORSHIP / Can an individual pay for an institution's membership?

Yes. If an individual would like to fund arXiv membership for an
eligible institution that does not currently participate in our
membership program, we are glad to work as intermediaries between the
individual and the institution.

<span id="7N"></span>

### SPONSORSHIP / How do I sponsor an institution?

Please have in mind an eligible institution or criteria for your
sponsorship (eg: your alma mater, or the heaviest-using institution in a
specific country), and contact us at membership@arxiv.org to get the ball
rolling. We request that sponsors make the same pledge that an
institution would (a good-faith five year commitment, annual invoicing).
We then contact the institution to confirm that a sponsored membership
is agreeable to them, and to gather some data. Sponsored institutions
have all the same rights and privileges as other Members, including
acknowledgement on our website (with the added text that their
membership is sponsored, and who it is sponsored by) and annual
statistics.

<span id="7O"></span>

### How can I stay up to date on arXiv?

Please join the arXiv support announcement email list by sending an
email message to arxiv-support-updates-L-request@cornell.edu. Leave the
subject line blank. The body of the message should be a single word:
