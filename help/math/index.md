# About the Math archive

The Math (math) archive formed on 1 December 1997 and you can read about the [announcement of archive here](/new/math).

You can browse articles and view categories at the [main math archive page](/archive/math).

The moderators for math are [listed here](/moderators#math).

## The arXiv Quantitative Biology Advisory Committee:

The advisory committee members serve as consultants to Cornell University and to the [arXiv scientific advisory board](/about/people/scientific_ad_board). All arXiv policy decisions are ultimately made by Cornell University.

## Historical notes

The old archives alg-geom, dg-ga, funct-an, and q-alg have been included as subject classifications. Old papers will be available as always, but new papers will be routed automatically to the math archive with the appropriate Subj-class. In October 2002 the subject classifications "LA - Linear Algebra" an "SC - Scientific Computation" were discontinued and folded into "RA - Rings and Algebras" and "NA - Numerical Analysis" respectively. In May 2004 the subject classification "PR - Probability Theory" was split into "PR - Probability" and "ST - Statistics". In July 2007 the subject classification "IT - Information Theory" was made an alias for "IT - Information Theory" in the cs archive.
