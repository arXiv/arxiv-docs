  - <span id="abs_filenames"></span>**Absolute filenames**  
    When including figures/style/class/macro files, you must use
    relative filenames instead of absolute filenames. For example,
    
    ``` 
         myfigure.png
    ```
    
    is correct, while:
    
    ``` 
         /users/staff/fred/myarticle/myfigure.png
    ```
    
    is not.
    
    Absolute filenames make it impossible for anyone to use the source
    without modifying it. Unless your TeX system happens to have the
    same directory structure as ours, then our automated processing will
    fail.
    
      

  - <span id="case_filenames"></span>**Upper-case vs Lower-case
    filenames**  
    If you use a computer with case-insensitive filenames (e.g.,
    Windows), be sure that the case of any filenames referred to in your
    TeX file matches exactly the files that are uploaded. For example,
    the command:
    
    ``` 
         \includegraphics{figure1.eps}
    ```
    
    will not work if the file is uploaded as
    
    ``` 
         FIGURE1.EPS
    ```
    
    because filenames are case-sensitive on our system.
    
      

  - <span id="missing_macro"></span>**Missing style/macro files**  
    Some authors write their own style/macro files (or modify standard
    ones), but forget to include them with the source. Be sure to
    include with the source any style/macro files that we don't have.
    
    **Note:** non-standard style/macro files provided along with the
    source must **NOT be attached** to a paper. Instead, submit them as
    separate files, or use **tar** or **zip** to combine them with the
    source files before submitting.
    
      

  - <span id="untested"></span>**Last minute untested changes**  
    All too often, an author will make last minute changes to the
    source, but won't test it to see if the results will TeX correctly.
    You can save yourself a lot of trouble by testing that everything
    works properly before submitting your paper.

  - <span id="intervention"></span>**User intervention**  
    Our source to postscript conversion system (called "AutoTeX") is
    *fully automated*. There is no genie present to answer questions
    such as:
    
    ``` 
      Would you like (P)ortrait or (L)andscape ? - answer P/L
    ```
    
    If your source needs to ask these types of question, please create a
    file called `filename.inp` (where `filename` matches the file it is
    to act on) that contains suitable responses.
    
    Your `.inp` file can be first tested on your local machine by
    running the following command:
    
    ``` 
      $ cat filename.inp | tex filename.tex
    ```
    
      

  - <span id="concatenated"></span> **Multiple files concatenated**  
    Do not submit several files all concatenated into one file, such as
    the Scientific Workplace's `.rap` file type -- such files cannot be
    separated automatically and may fail to process in unexpected ways.
    Instead, please create a `.tar.gz` or `.zip` file.
    
      

  - <span id="old_style"></span> **Use of old or non-standard style
    files**  
    Style files change with time, and you (or we) might be using old
    versions of style files. We try to keep up to date, so if problems
    arise due to style files, please check that the version you are
    using is current.
    
    Some well-known style files, e.g., `epsf.sty` and `epsfig.sty`, have
    been altered by TeX programmers, then uploaded to web sites under
    the same filename. This is **very bad practice** and anti-social
    behavior, since we end up with multiple versions of *standard*
    styles. arXiv will make every effort to support the most recent
    **and** official versions of standard style files.
    
    As an example, the `graphics` and `graphicx` packages have been
    standard since the release of LaTeX 2e and are the recommended
    graphics inclusion macros. These packages provide the most portable
    and reliable method of including graphics.

  - <span id="dvips_clash"></span> **Style files incompatible with
    dvips**  
    Style files that are incompatible with `dvips`, e.g., `epsbox.sty`,
    can cause problems. If the DVI requires exotic versions of `dvips`
    (e.g., `jdvi2kps`) to produce postscript, then our automated system
    will **fail**.
    
    Please make every effort to avoid using non-standard styles and
    `dvi2ps` utilities. Few people will be able to process papers in
    these non-standard formats.
    
      

  - <span id="other_formats"></span> **Sources that rely on something
    other than TeX or LaTeX**  
    All papers should be formatted so they work with TeX or LaTeX (as
    appropriate). If you use other formats (as opposed to style files or
    macros), e.g., **AMS-TeX**, **AMS-LaTeX**, or **aatex**, then please
    add the appropriate line to the top of the source, e.g.:
    
    ``` 
         %&amslplain
    ```
    
    for **AMS-LaTeX** (based on amslatex version 1.1),
    
    ``` 
         \input amstex
    ```
    
    or
    
    ``` 
         %&amstex
    ```
    
    for **AMS-TeX**, and
    
    ``` 
         \input cp-aa.tex
    ```
    
    or
    
    ``` 
         %&cp-aa
    ```
    
    for Springer-Verlag's Plain TeX Astronomy & Astrophysics macros,
    **cp-aa** (also known as **aatex**).
    
    Anything that relies on something **other than TeX or (PDF)LaTeX**
    will fail. At this time arXiv does not support processing with:
    XeTeX and its variants including LuaTeX, LyX, or PDFTeX.
    
      

  - <span id="fonts"></span> **Use of unusual/uncommon fonts**  
    Authors should keep in mind that if they use unusual fonts, many
    potential readers of their work won't have them installed.
    
    Because it would require significant admin time to install and
    maintain non-standard fonts, we do not generally support such fonts.
    
    It is, however, possible to include your local metafont `.mf` files
    as well as your local `fontmap.map` file. This will require special
    handling with a `00README.XXX` file with the appropriate **fontmap**
    directive.
    
      

  - <span id="protect"></span> **Unprotected `\cite` and other macros
    inside figure `\caption` commands, "`line too long`" error**  
    In LaTeX, any citations inside a figure `\caption` should be
    protected using the `\protect` command; e.g., `\caption{Electron
    spectral function from \protect\cite{spectral}}`. This delays the
    expansion of the citation until the second latex pass, i.e., when
    the reference has been defined.
    
      

  - <span id="auto_ignore"></span> **Marking files to be ignored**  
    If you need to include files in the source that should not be
    processed by the automated system, you may do either of the
    following:
    
    1.  Add:
        
        ``` 
              %auto-ignore
        ```
        
        near the top of the file. This directive can be anywhere in the
        first 10 lines of the file, and anywhere on the line. It should
        appear before any TeX or LaTeX commands, since otherwise they
        would be recognized first. For example:
        
        ``` 
             %auto-ignore
             This is a README file for paper hep-ex/9901003
        
             More data for our experiment is available at http://www.some.where/else
        ```
    
    2.  Include a file `00README.XXX` with your submission that includes
        the line:
        
        ``` 
             filename ignore
        ```
        
        for each file that should be ignored.
    
      

  - <span id="bbox"></span> **"`! Missing number, treated as zero`"
    error**  
    If you use `epsf` to include PostScript figures you must make sure
    that the `%%BoundingBox` definitions are near the start of the
    PostScript figure files. In order to reduce processing time, our TeX
    system does not scan the whole of each included file.
    
    If you have a file with the following structure:
    
    ``` 
         %!PS-Adobe-3.0 ...
         ...
         %%BoundingBox: (atend)
         ...
         [ bulk of PS file in here ]
         ...
         %%BoundingBox: 0 10 234 456
         ...
         %%EOF
    ```
    
    then simply move the `%%BoundingBox` line to the top:
    
    ``` 
         %!PS-Adobe-3.0 ...
         ...
         %%BoundingBox: 0 10 234 456
         ...
         [ bulk of PS file in here ]
         ...
         %%EOF
    ```
    
      

  - <span id="nohypertex"></span> **To disable HyperTeX**  
    By default, our TeX system uses [HyperTeX](/hypertex) to add
    hyperlinks between references, sections and equations within your
    paper. These show up in the PDF (and in the PostScript with some
    viewers).
    
    HyperTeX conflicts with a few style and class files. If you think
    this is a problem, you can disable HyperTeX for your submission by
    including a file `00README.XXX`. It should contain the line:
    
    ``` 
         nohypertex
    ```
    
    Note that HyperTeX changes the way citations appear in some styles
    -- ranges will be represented as \[11, 12, 13\] instead of
    \[11-13\]. This is necessary for HyperTeX to be able to make
    individual links to each citation. Unless you feel very strongly
    about this we recommend leaving HyperTeX on.

  - <span id="include_subdir"></span> **"`Can't write subdir/file.aux`"
    and other problems with write permissions during TeX processing**  
    In our system, only the top level directory is granted write
    permission during processing. Attempts to write files to
    subdirectories will fail.
    
    All files included via `\include` instead of `\input` must be in the
    top level directory. This is because the `\include` command attempts
    to write a separate `.aux` file in the same directory as the
    included file. For example:
    
    ``` 
         \input{file}           %OK, does not create separate .aux file
         \input{subdir/file}    %OK, does not create separate .aux file
    
         \include{file}         %OK because file.aux can be written
         \include{subdir/file}  %WILL FAIL fail because sub/file.aux cannot be written
    ```
    
      

  - <span id="double_subscript"></span> **"`! Double
    subscript/superscript`" errors**  
    Our TeX system complains about double subscripts (and superscripts)
    because `a_x_y` could be read as `a_{x_y}` or `{a_x}_y` or `a_x{}_y`
    or even `a_{xy}`. These are not the same since the character size
    and position is affected.
    
    Some older TeX systems would automatically substitute `a_x{}_y`
    without the need for user intervention, but current TeX systems
    (including ours) will not do this. As a result, **the appropriate
    interpretation must be explicitly specified**.
    
    If you are curious about the differences, see [these
    examples](doublesubscript).
    
      

  - <span id="bad_pdfmark"></span> **PDF conversion failure in papers
    with complex section structure**  
    In some papers with "elaborate" section structure, hyperref can
    generate PostScript that contains bad pdfmarks which break PDF
    conversion. This problem affects mostly longer papers, reviews,
    theses, etc., i.e. those papers where a linked table of contents
    (TOC) and document outline would be most useful\!
    
    The reason is that the section counter (used for the names of
    destination links) is reset by authors and certain macros to control
    the numbering of appendix sections. The result is failure of ps2pdf
    conversion due to ambiguous pdfmarks or conflicting subsection count
    in the pdfmarks.
    
    The simple cure is to [disable HyperTex](#nohypertex) but a better
    work-around is to simply switch off bookmarks (i.e. document
    outline) while leaving normal document linking on. You can do this
    by adding the following line to the
    preamble:
    
    ``` 
                                                                                              
        \usepackage[bookmarks=false]{hyperref}
    ```
    
      

  - <span id="ifpdf"></span> **arXiv system attempts processing with
    PDFLaTeX for submissions which are regular latex**  
    A common mistake made by authors as well as many macro packages is
    incorrect testing for \\pdfoutput to decide whether pdflatex is run
    in dvi mode or pdf mode, or whether the processing is done in
    regular latex mode. The underlying engines used to be different and
    a simple test for \\ifx\\pdfoutput\\undefined was sufficient to
    distinguish between all options. This is no longer the case, because
    the underlying engine is the same for all 3 cases and therefore the
    value of the \\pdfoutput parameter has to be tested, too.
    
    That is, a common (but incorrect) testing sequence might look like:
    "\\ifx\\pdfoutput\\undefined .... \\else ..... \\fi". Symptoms of
    this mistake might be:
    
      - error messages "Option clash for package ...."
      - some unexpected message about various pdf operators
      - failing figure inclusions (due to unrecognized extension)
    
    The most reliable way to accomplish conditional branching in the TeX
    source where necessary is instead via the ifpdf package:
    
    ``` 
        \usepackage{ifpdf}
        \ifpdf
          do something pdflatex specific here
        \else
          do something for regular latex or pdflatex in dvi mode
        \fi
    ```
    
    Note that the graphics package and the hyperref package are smart
    enough to figure this out on their own. You do **not** need to
    specify any driver for these packages.
    
    For more information, see:
    
    <https://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf>
    
    You can download the ifpdf macro from the above link as well, if it
    is not already a part of your tex tree.
    
    In the extremely rare event that your submision still does not
    correctly identify itself as latex, and you are absolutely sure, you
    can add the line:
    
    ``` 
    %&latex 
      
    ```
    
    as the very first line of your tex file.
    
      

  - <span id="wrongtex"></span> **Why does arXiv's system fail to
    recognize the main tex file?**   
    It is possible in writing your latex code to include your
    `\documentclass` directive in a file other than the main .tex file.
    While this is perfectly reasonable for a human who's compling to
    know which of the tex files is the main one (even when using
    something obvious as the filename, such as `ms.tex`), our AutoTeX
    system will attempt to process whichever file has the
    `\documentclass` directive as the main tex file.
    
    Note that the system does not process using `Makefile` or any other
    manifest-type files.
    
      

<span id="psbad"></span> **Problems with inclusion of binary or other
bitmap figures; `PS BAD` warnings**

*Update 2011-12-06: arXiv's default dvips configuration was changed to
retain comments. The following does not apply to papers received since
then.*

By default, our TeX system tells `dvips` to strip comment lines from
included PostScript figures. This is usually the correct thing to do
because it prevents DSC (Document Structuring Comments) lines from being
included from figures. If included, these would likely break the DSC
structure of the final PostScript (the DSC structure is what allows
viewers to display an index of page numbers).

Lines starting with '`%`' in the included PostScript files are
identified as comments, but sometimes PostScript figures include blocks
of data with lines starting with '`%`' that are not comments. Removal of
these lines may break the final PostScript. You can turn off the removal
of comments from included figures for your submission by including a
file `00README.XXX`. It should contain an instruction specific to the
filename of the dvi file:

``` 
     filename.dvi keepcomments
```

You can test the effect of this yourself by comparing the output of

``` 
     $ dvips -R -K1 yourfile.dvi -o DSCstripped.ps
     $ dvips -R -K0 yourfile.dvi -o DSCkept.ps
```

Note that this whole issue arises because Adobe decided to use the
ignored "Comments" from the PostScript standard to provide additional
structure to regular PostScript files, which leads to complications for
programs that rely on proper DSC structure when two or more such files
are included in each other.
