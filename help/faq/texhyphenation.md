# Hyphenation Patterns for Languages other than American English

Our standard LaTeX installation supports only the default american hyphenation pattern and nohyphenation. However, you may request an extended version of LaTeX that supports the following hyphenation patterns:

```
> american
> british
> french
> german
> ngerman
> danish
> dutch
> italian
> portuges
> spanish
> nohyphenation
```

To request the extended version of LaTeX please add the following line to the top of the main LaTeX file in your submission:

```
%&biglatex
```

We do not support additional hyphenation patterns for plain TeX.
