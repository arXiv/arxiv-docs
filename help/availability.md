Submissions to arXiv are typically made public Sunday through
Thursday, with no announcements Friday or Saturday. Check the [current
time](https://arxiv.org/localtime) at the arXiv main site, with the
amount of time remaining before the deadline. Submissions are made public as part of the scheduled announcement process. This includes new submissions as well as [replacements](/help/replace), [withdrawal notices](/help/withdraw), [cross listings](/help/cross) and [journal reference](/help/jref). Journal reference submissions do not appear in the mailings, but are still processed at that time.

A note about arXiv-id assignments
---------------------------------

The final [arXiv identifier](arxiv_identifier) cannot be assigned until the paper is announced, so please do not ask for it ahead of announcement. It is not possible to make exceptions, nor accelerate the announcement schedule regardless of your circumstance. 

**Note:** The arXiv identifier cannot be back-dated, so identifiers will be assigned in the month of first announcement. It may be the case that a submission appears in a different identifier month than its original submission date due to various factors.

On Deferred Mailings
--------------------

On the occasion that arXiv defers a mailing (either for locally celebrated holidays such as Thanksgiving or for ad hoc reasons), this information may be found on the [arXiv status](https://status.arxiv.org), or on the [arXiv blog](https://blog.arxiv.org).
