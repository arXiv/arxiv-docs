## Can I reuse figures from an arXiv paper?

A short answer is "it depends". More specifically: 
  - If the [license](license) applied to the work allows for remixing or reuse with citation, then yes. 
  - If not, then no. 
  - If the version is assigned the [arXiv perpetual non-exclusive license](https://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/), you will need to contact the submitter or copyright holder (if published) to determine applicable permissions.

## Do I need arXiv's permission to repost the full text?

**Note:** All e-prints submitted to arXiv are subject to copyright protections. arXiv is not the copyright holder on any of the e-prints in our corpus. 

In some cases, submitters have provided permission in advance by submitting their e-print under a permissive [Creative Commons license](license#licenses-available). The overwhelming majority of e-prints are submitted using the [arXiv perpetual non-exclusive license](https://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/), which does not grant further reuse permissions directly. In these cases you will need to contact the author directly with your request.
