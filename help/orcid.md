ORCID identifiers
=================

[ORCID](http://orcid.org/)® iDs are unique researcher identifiers
designed to provide a transparent method for linking researchers and
contributors to their activities and outputs. arXiv allows you to link
your ORCID iD with your arXiv account. This linkage will allow your
works on arXiv to be unambiguously connected to your works in other
systems. It will help with the ongoing challenge of distinguishing your
research activities from those of others with similar names.

We encourage all arXiv authors to link their ORCID iD with arXiv. If you
don't already have an ORCID iD, you can create one as part of this
process. Once completed you will see your ORCID iD on your [user
page](/user).

arXiv will use ORCID iDs in preference to the internal [arXiv author
identifiers](author_identifiers) in order to facilitate better data
exchange. The arXiv author identifiers will remain to provide local user
profile pages. For more information about ORCID, refer to the [ORCID
site](https://orcid.org/content/about-orcid).
