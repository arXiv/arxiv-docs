As a repository for scholarly material, arXiv keeps a permanent record of every article and version posted. All articles on arXiv.org can be viewed and downloaded freely by anyone.

To maintain this scholarly record, arXiv needs permission from submitters to post and distribute their work. Permission is granted through a license, chosen by the submitter, and the submitter must certify that they have the right to grant that license.

Several types of licenses are available, listed below. For all licenses here, with the exception of CC Zero, the original copyright holder retains ownership after posting on arXiv.

How to choose a license
-----------------------

arXiv values open access and encourages choosing a liberal license for re-use of the paper. However, each situation is unique. Funders may require specific licenses. Journals have different policies regarding preprints, embargo periods, and post-publication distribution. Please note that different versions of the work can have different licenses.

Ultimately, it is the submitter’s responsibility to choose the appropriate license for their content. The license chosen is irrevocable and cannot be changed.

To make a license decision, arXiv recommends the following:
1. Read and understand the [submission terms and agreement](policies/submission_agreement) and [instructions for submission](policies/instructions_for_submission)
2. Understand the meanings and implications of each license below
3. Check the policies of funders and journals (contact journals directly or using a third-party service such as [Sherpa Romeo](https://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/about.html)
4. Consult with colleagues in your field of study
5. Remember that articles posted on arXiv are a permanent part of the scholarly record and the license chosen for each version is irrevocable.

CC0 allows reusers to distribute, remix, adapt, and build upon the material in any medium or format, with no conditions.

Metadata license
----------------
A [Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) will apply to all metadata.

Copyright notices
-----------------
Often, PDFs found on publisher websites or supplied as proofs are the property of the publisher, which often owns the copyright and/or licenses their use. Submission of PDFs with copyright statements which prohibit or impair arXiv's redistribution license will be rejected. If explicit permission is given for open access redistribution, these are permissible.

If you have permission from a publisher to upload content to arXiv provided that you include a special copyright statement with the paper, place that statement on the first page of the text of the submission. Copyright notices should not be included in the separate [metadata](/help/prep#comments) and will be removed.

If you have any additional questions about arXiv's copyright and licensing policies, please [contact](/help/contact) the arXiv administrators directly.
