arXiv License Information
=========================

arXiv is a repository for scholarly material, and perpetual access is
necessary to maintain the scholarly record. As such, arXiv keeps a
permanent record of every submission and replacement announced.

arXiv does not ask that copyright be transferred. However, we require
sufficient rights to allow us to distribute submitted articles in
perpetuity. In order to submit an article to arXiv, the submitter must
either:

-   grant arXiv.org a [non-exclusive and irrevocable license to
    distribute the
    article](http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/license.html),
    and certify that the submitter has the right to grant this license;
-   certify that the work is available under one of the following
    Creative Commons licenses and that the submitter has the right to assign
    this license:
    -   [Creative Commons Attribution license (CC BY
        4.0)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
    -   [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license (CC BY-SA
        4.0)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)
    -   [Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-ShareAlike license
        (CC BY-NC-SA
        4.0)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/);
-   or dedicate the work to the public domain by associating the
    [Creative Commons Public Domain Dedication (CC0
    1.0)](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) with the
    submission.

In the most common case, authors have the right to grant these licenses
because they hold copyright in their own work.

We currently support three of the [Creative Commons
licenses](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/). If you wish to use a
different CC license, then select arXiv's non-exclusive license to
distribute in the arXiv submission process and indicate the desired
Creative Commons license in the actual article.

*Note:* if you intend to submit, or have submitted, your article to a
journal then you should verify that the license you select during arXiv
submission does not conflict with the journal's license or copyright
transfer agreement. Many journal agreements permit submission to arXiv
using the [non-exclusive license to
distribute](http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/license.html),
which arXiv has used since 2004. Yet the [CC
BY](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) and [CC
BY-SA](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) licenses permit
commercial reuse and may therefore conflict with some journal
agreements.

Authority to submit, publisher PDFs, etc.
-----------------------------------------

arXiv cannot accept papers that contain material for which the depositor
does not have the authority to submit or to agree to the license terms.
This would include comments by referees (which may have separate
copyright protection) and, of course, plagiarized material. Note that
any single co-author normally has all needed authority to submit a paper
to arXiv. Once publicly available, articles cannot be entirely removed,
either at the request of the submitting author or of any co-author.

It is usually the case that PDFs found on publisher websites or supplied
as proofs are the property of the publisher, which often owns the
copyright and/or licenses their use. Even if the author retains
copyright or permissions in the article, arXiv cannot accept PDFs that
have been downloaded from a publisher's website unless arXiv has a
blanket agreement with the publisher (it would be too costly in
administrative time to track individual permissions).

Licenses granted are irrevocable
--------------------------------

Authors should take care to upload an article *only if they are certain*
that they will not later wish to publish it in a journal that prohibits
prior distribution on an e-print server. *arXiv will not remove an
announced article to comply with such a journal policy -- the license
granted on submission is irrevocable.* However, granting rights for
arXiv to distribute an article does not preclude later copyright
assignment. Authors are thus free to publish submissions that already
appear on arXiv. Authors may wish to inform the journal publisher that a
prior non-exclusive license exists before transferring copyright or
granting a publication license. Please check the policies of any
potential publication venue before uploading to arXiv. (For the policy
information of many publishers, see the
[SHERPA/RoMEO](http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo.php) site.)

Copyright notices
-----------------

If you have permission from a publisher to upload content to arXiv
provided that you include a special copyright statement with the paper,
the correct place for that statement is the first page of the text of
the submission. Copyright notices should not be included in the separate
[metadata](http://arxiv.org/help/prep#comments) and will be removed.

If you have any additional questions about arXiv's copyright and
licensing policies, please [contact](http://arxiv.org/help/contact) the
arXiv administrators directly.
