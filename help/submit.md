Submission Guidelines
====================

<span id="guidelines"></span> Submissions to arXiv should be topical and refereeable scientific contributions that follow accepted standards of scholarly communication:

-   We only accept submissions from [registered authors](registerhelp). If you are a new user or are submitting to a new category, you may be required to find [endorsements](/help/endorsement).
-   All submissions are subject to a [moderation process](/help/moderation) that verifies material is appropriate and relevant. Material that contains offensive language, non-scientific content, or is plagiarized may be removed.  
-   Authors must grant arXiv.org a [non-exclusive and irrevocable
    license to distribute](license) or certify that the work is
    available under another license that conveys these rights.
-   Authors must agree to [arXiv terms of
    submission](terms_of_submission).
-   Authors are expected to self-submit. Submissions by a third party are accepted under limited conditions. See instructions for [third-party submissions](third_party_submission) and [index submissions](submit_index) for conference proceedings.
-   New submissions received by 14:00 (Eastern Daylight/Standard Time Zone) are generally made [available](/help/versions) at 20:00 (Eastern), but are subject to delays in the moderation process (see the [schedule for details](#availability).) 

Submission Preparation
====================
-   [Formats for text submission](#text)
-   [Formats for figures](#figures)
-   [File names and case sensitivity](#files)
-   [Inclusion of data sets and ancillary files (data, programs,
    etc.)](#datasets)
-   [Title and Abstract preparation](#prep)
-   [Verify and correct your submission](#correct)
-   [Edit or replace your submission](#replace)


To submit an article, use the [Submit form](http://arxiv.org/submit)
    or select "START NEW SUBMISSION" from your [user
    page](http://arxiv.org/user).

<span id="text"></span>

Formats for text of submission
------------------------------

Your submission to the archive must be in one of the following formats
(listed in order of preference):

-   [(La)TeX, AMS(La)TeX, PDFLaTeX](submit_tex)
-   [PDF](submit_pdf)
-   [HTML with JPEG/PNG/GIF images](submit_html)

Our goal is to store articles in formats which are highly portable and
stable over time. Currently, the best choice is TeX/LaTeX, because this
open format does not hide information. Note that for this, and other
[reasons](/help/faq/whytex), we will not accept dvi, PS, or PDF created
from TeX/LaTeX source. Note also that we
will not accept scanned documents, regardless of format.

<span id="figures"></span>

Formats for figures
-------------------

Accepted figure formats include:

-   PostScript, PS, EPS - requires [LaTeX processing](submit_tex#latex)
-   JPEG, GIF, PNG or PDF figures - requires [PDFLaTeX processing](submit_tex#pdflatex) 

Figure files should not exceed XX size. Note that
we do not accept submissions with omitted figures, even if links to view figures externally are provided. See our [information on submission sizes](sizes)
and our [bitmapping help](bitmap) for more information. If you have
problems with a large submission, [contact arXiv
administrators](/help/contact).

If you submit figures with your (La)TeX source, use standard macro
packages (e.g., the `graphics` and `graphicx` packages) to have
figures appear in the document. arXiv administration
cannot provide help with TeX-related issues.

<span id="files"></span>

File names and case sensitivity
-------------------------------

arXiv will accept only the following characters in file names:

> `a-z A-Z 0-9 _ + - . , = `

The presence of any other character (e.g., spaces, question marks,
asterisks) will cause the system to reject the file upload or
submission. These restrictions ensure maximum portability of the stored
files and minimize archival risk.

File names and extensions are also case sensitive on our system. The
file names `Figure1.PDF` and `figure1.pdf` are not the same. Whether
your local system is case sensitive (e.g., Unix) or not (e.g., Windows)
you must ensure that internal file references such as LaTeX figure
inclusion commands match case exactly.

<span id="datasets"></span>

Inclusion of ancillary files
------------------------------------------

There are limited facilities for including data sets and ancillary files
(data, programs, etc.) which are associated with articles submitted to
arXiv. See [separate instructions](ancillary_files) about including data sets
and ancillary files.

<span id="prep"></span>

Title and abstract preparation
--------------------------

See [separate instructions for preparing the title and abstract](prep) for inclusion in metadata. This information is used on the
abstract pages, in announcements, in RSS feeds, and to support
searching.

<span id="correct"></span>

Verify and correct your submission
---------------------------------------

Before you make the final "Submit Article" step in the submission
process, be sure to carefully check the title and abstract (metadata)
and the processed files and correct any errors. [Contact arXiv
administrators](/help/contact) for help.

If you discover an error after submission but before public announcement,
select the Unsubmit (![unsubmit icon](/images/unsubmit.png)) icon
next to the submission on your [user page](http://arxiv.org/user). This will
return it to the [incomplete status](submit_status#incomplete) and allow you to 
modify your files and resubmit.

Unsubmitting an article takes the article out of the processing queue, and announcement will be scheduled based on the later resubmission time. See the schedule of [availability](#availability).

<span id="replace"></span>

Edit or replace your submission
----------------------------

Edits before a submission is publicly announced will not generate additional versions.
The date stamp associated with the submission will
be the time that the final "Submit Article" step is completed. Edits and
final submission before 14:00 US Eastern Time (EDT/EST) Monday through
Friday will not delay announcement. You may wish to check [current local
time](http://arXiv.org/localtime) at main site.

We encourage authors to update and to make corrections in their
articles. **DO NOT** make a new submission for a corrected article or
for an erratum. Rather [replace](replace) the original submission.

<span id="availability"></span>

Availability of submissions and announcement order
--------------------------------------------------

Submissions to arXiv are normally made public on Sunday through
Thursday, with no announcements Friday or Saturday. Check the [current
time](https://arxiv.org/localtime) at the arXiv main site, with the
amount of time remaining before the deadline.
