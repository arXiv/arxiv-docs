# arXiv API Access

arXiv offers public API access in order to maximize its openness and interoperability. Many projects utilize this option without becoming official [arXivLabs collaborations](labs.arxiv.org). 

**Commercial projects** that utilize arXiv’s public APIs or other [bulk data pipelines](help/bulk_data) are requested to contact arXiv at [nextgen@arxiv.org](mailto:nextgen@arxiv.org), sign a memorandum of understanding, and become an arXiv affiliate before embarking on the project. This includes any project created as a product for sale.

**Independent, noncommercial, and open access projects** that…

- utilize arXiv’s public APIs 
- do not require assistance from arXiv, and 
- do not use the names “arXiv”, “arXiv.org”, “arXiv Labs”, “arXivLabs” or associated logos, web addresses and colors
are free, open access, and/or intended for research or educational purposes

...are considered entirely independent from arXiv. 

**For all API users**, 

- Familiarize yourself with arXiv’s [API Terms of Use](tou).
- Review the [API Basics](basics) and the [API User Manual](user-manual). 
- Acknowledge arXiv data usage with this statement on your product: “Thank you to arXiv for use of its open access interoperability.”
- Do not brand your project with arXiv’s names (“arXiv”, “arXiv.org”, “arXiv Labs”, “arXivLabs”) or use associated logos, web addresses, and colors in a manner that implies arXiv’s endorsement of the project.
- Check out the arXiv [API user community](basics#community) to learn, ask questions, and share information about your project. 
- Review these additional resources about arXiv’s interoperability: [arXiv’s identifier scheme](help/arxiv_identifier_for_services), [bulk data access information](help/bulk_data), and the [Open Archives Initiative](help/oa). 

Does your project positively benefit the arXiv community and require significant assistance from arXiv staff? If so, learn more about how to apply to become an [arXivLabs collaborator](labs.arxiv.org).
