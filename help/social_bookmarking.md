Social Bookmarking
==================

[Social Bookmarking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_bookmarking) services allow user 
to save link to web resources they want to remember or share. The link information is 
usually public and used in ranking and searching. Most sites offer additional facilities
for tagging, commentary, and varying degrees of private data collection.

We have selected a few commonly used sites to display on arXiv abstract pages. There are
a collection of social bookmarking service icons in the right-hand box labeled **Bookmark**. 
The site name is shown if you mouse-over an icon. [BibSonomy](http://www.bibsonomy.org/) 
is designed specifically for scholarly bookmarking.

Social bookmarking services can be used without links on arXiv pages or other web sites of
interest. There are browser plugins for many social bookmarking services that will work on
any web page. Check with the documentation for the service that interests you.
