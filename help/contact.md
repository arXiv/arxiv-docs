Contacting arXiv
===============================

## Technical queries

For paper submission problems, accounts, etc.

Before contacting us, please review our [help](/help) and [FAQ](/help/faq) pages to see if your problem is explained there.

If you would like further assistance, please submit your questions via email. You may contact arXiv administrators at one of the addresses listed below. Please include a detailed description of your problem. Note that arXiv help and moderation 
email addresses are monitored between 0900-1700 Eastern time, Monday through Friday, subject to
administrator availability and the holiday schedule.

For **technical queries** 

-   Send a precise email, including all relevant details (especially paper ids, rejection ids, URLs, etc.) to <help@arxiv.org>.
-   If you receive an automated response to your email, please read all
    instructions carefully.
    -   If there is no other identifying information in your message
        (e.g., paper id or rejection id), you may need to address your
        email with **"Dear arXiv,"** to bypass our SPAM filter.
-   *Do not* include attachments with your email.
    -   If your submission has failed, quote the rejection identifier in
        your email.
    -   If you need to correct files in your submission, [make a
        replacement](replace).
    -   If you feel that a file is necessary to explain your problem,
        first send an email with as many details as possible and ask if
        the attachment is truly necessary.
-   *Always* contact arXiv administrators before your submission is
    [announced](versions) if there is a technical problem that
    prevents processing.

## Moderation queries

For **moderation queries** (including questions about account status or
submission modifications):

-   Send a precise email, including all relevant details (especially
    paper ids, former correspondence, submission summaries, etc.) to
    <moderation@arxiv.org>.
-   If you receive an automated response to your email, please read all
    instructions carefully.
    -   If there is no other identifying information in your message
        (e.g., paper id or rejection id), you may need to address your
        email with **"Dear arXiv-moderation,"** to bypass our SPAM
        filter.
-   Please be *patient*, as moderation appeals are complicated and may
    take some time.
