    summary: |
      arXiv Bibliographic Explorer displays information about works that cite
      and are cited by arXiv papers and their published versions. The primary
      objective of the project is to enable discovery of relevant research and
      context by providing user-friendly navigation of an article's citation
      tree.

      is an innovative research discovery tool. It combines interactive
      citation maps, modern search tools, and targeted updates to create a
      cohesive research discovery experience. It can visualize your research
      topic with everything from articles, patents, books, pre-prints, and
      e-prints. From arXiv abstract pages, you can build a literature map from
      the arXiv article you are viewing, visualizing the top connected
      articles, and browse the citation network around it.

    summary: |
      Hugging Face Spaces includes links to demos created by the community or the authors themselves. By going to the Demos tab of your favorite paper in the arXiv categories of computer science, statistics, or electrical engineering and systems science, you can find links to open-source demos and try them out immediately. With Spaces, Hugging Face users can share, explore, discuss models, and build interactive applications that enable anyone with a browser to try them out without having to run any code. These demos are built using open-source tools such as the Gradio and Streamlit Python libraries, and leverage models and datasets available on the Hugging Face Hub.

    - name: Domenic Rosati
      association: Scite Smart
    summary: |
      Scite is a platform for discovering and evaluating scientific articles via Smart Citations. Smart Citations allow users to see how a publication has been cited by providing the context of the citation and a classification describing whether it provides supporting or contrasting evidence for the cited claim. With the Scite Smart Labs project, viewers can see this information directly on the abstracts page.
  iarxiv:
    title: IArxiv
    thumbnail: ../images/iarxiv-logo.jpg
    more_info:
    - name: About IArxiv
      link: https://iarxiv.org/about
    - name: Sign Up

    collaborators:
    - name: Ezequiel Alvarez
      association: ICAS, Professor at UNSAM
    - name: Cesar Miquel
      association: Easytech
    summary: |
      IArxiv allows readers to receive, by email, daily arXiv papers in a growing number of categories sorted by artificial intelligence according to their preferences. IArxiv learns each reader’s preferences first by fetching previous papers authored by the reader. Then, those preferences are updated over time based on the papers opened by that reader within the emails or on iarxiv.org. IArxiv runs an unsupervised Machine Learning algorithm, called LDA, to extract which topics are present in each paper, and in which proportions, to construct a vector of topics for each reader.
  sciencecast:
    title: ScienceCast
    thumbnail: ../images/sciencecast-logo.png
    more_info:
    - name: About ScienceCast
      link: https://iarxiv.org/about
    collaborators:
    - name: Andres Jiranek
      association: Science Cast, Inc.
    summary: |
      ScienceCast links arXiv papers to interactive video presentations. ScienceCast is a free open-access platform for researchers to disseminate their scientific results and ideas to a wide audience of fellow scientists.
  replicate:
    title: Replicate
    thumbnail: ../images/replicate-logo.png
    more_info:
    - name: About Replicate
      link: https://replicate.com/about
    - name: Replicate arXiv docs
      link: https://replicate.com/docs/arxiv
    collaborators:
    - name: the Replicate team
      association: Replicate
    summary: |
      Machine learning is still extremely hard to use. Research is typically published as a PDF, with scraps of code on GitHub and weights on Google Drive. The Replicate Labs project makes it easy to share and associate your machine learning model with your arXiv paper in a way that is easy for other people to use.

# arXivLabs: Showcase

arXiv is surrounded by a community of researchers and developers working at the cutting edge of information science and technology.

While the arXiv team is focused on our core mission—providing rapid dissemination of research findings at no cost to readers and submitters—we are excited to be experimenting with a small number of collaborators on projects that add value for our stakeholders and advance research.

Below are some of the projects that our collaborators have done.
